"[Pökler's] course in polymer theory was taught by Professor-Doctor Laszlo Jamf, who was latest in the true succession, Liebig to August Wilhelm **von Hofmann**, to Herbert Ganister to Laszlo Jamf, a direct chain"

Consider coal and steel. There is a place where they meet. The interface between coal and steel is coal-tar...                  
We thought of this as an industrial process. It was more. We passed over the coal-tars. A thousand different molecules waited in the preterite dung. This is the sign of revealing. Of unfolding. This is one meaning of mauve, the first new color on Earth, leaping to Earth’s light from its grave miles and aeons below
 You must ask two questions. First, what is the real nature of synthesis? And then: what is the real nature of control?

How alphabetic the nature of molecules

the German mania for name-giving, dividing the Creation finer and finer, analyzing, setting namer more hopelessly apart from named, even to bringing in the mathematics of combination, tacking together established nouns to get new ones, the insanely, endlessly diddling play of a **chemist whose molecules are words**

 the cosmic Serpent, in the violet splendor of its scales

- 414 [??]

Pökler's old prof, Laszlo Jamf, at this point in the spiel removing from his fob a **gold hexagon** with the German formée cross in the center, a medal of honor from IG Farben

To find that Gravity, taken so for granted, is really something eerie, Messianic, extrasensory in Earth’s mindbody . . . having hugged to its holy center the wastes of dead species, gathered, packed, transmuted, realigned, and rewoven molecules to be taken up again by the coal-tar Kabbalists of the other side..

THE LAST GREEN AND MAGENTA

The Heath grows green and magenta in all directions, earth and heather, coming of age  —
 No. it was spring

[is the No. nature avoiding the artificial purple]??

There were touches of **royal purple** in the air, not bright enough to blur out over their edges

Tyrone = Tyrian = purple, royalty, ascended. The elect.

Sloth = sin, preterie
Schloth = smokestack
Rop = rope (hangs in a parabola)
Tropf = drip

OMG

"You think you’d rather hear about what you call ‘life’: the growing, organic Kartell. But it’s only another illusion. A very clever robot. The more dynamic it seems to you, the more deep and dead, in reality, it grows. Look at the **smokestacks**, how they proliferate, fanning the wastes of original waste over greater and greater masses of city. Structurally, they are strongest in compression. A smokestack can survive any explosion -- even the shock wave from one of the new cosmic bombs"

Schloth = Smokestack 
Survives any explosion like Slothrop survives all the V-2 strikes.

Descends into the toilet, descends into the underground.
He is literally the coal tar muck racking. Turning organic death into mauve. And then disappears as the rainbows colours combine. Into dissolution.

After Casino Hermann Goering section Tyrone is always wearing Green and Purple. They would combine into white, cancel. Like in film (as has been analysed by Haylse and Eiser)

Purple == death, extraction, and artificial chemicals (aniline)
Green  == life, growth, and the natural (chlorophyll)
