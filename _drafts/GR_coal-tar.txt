"You think you’d rather hear about what you call ‘life’: the growing, organic Kartell. But it’s only another illusion. A very clever robot. The more dynamic it seems to you, the more deep and dead, in reality, it grows. Look at the **smokestacks**, how they proliferate, fanning the wastes of original waste over greater and greater masses of city. Structurally, they are strongest in compression. A smokestack can survive any explosion -- even the shock wave from one of the new cosmic bombs"

Bland, still an apprentice, hadn’t yet shaken off his fondness

are layers, set very deep, layers of history analogous to layers
of coal and oil in Earth’s body

life so clangorous and mad, such a **green** corona about Earth’s

Creation apart. So we, the crippled keepers, were sent out to

* Benzene
. Indeed, she has noted
Captain Bounce now and then among her nightly admirers,
noted in particular an item of belly-brass that Slothrop’s seen
too: a gold benzene ring with a formée cross in the
center—the IG Farben Award for Meritorious Contributions
to Synthetics Research. Bounce got that one back in ’32. The
industrial liaison it suggests was indeed dozing at the bottom
of Slothrop’s mind when the Rocket Guidance Transmitter
Question arose.

L. Jamf, among
others, then proposed, logically, dialectically, taking the
parental polyamide sections of the new chain, and looping
them around into rings too, giant “heterocyclic” rings, to
alternate with the aromatic rings. This principle was easily
extended to other precursor molecules. A desired monomer of
high molecular weight could be synthesized to order, bent
into its heterocyclic ring, clasped, and strung in a chain along
with the more “natural” benzene or aromatic rings. Such
chains would be known as “aromatic heterocyclic polymers.”
One hypothetical chain that Jamf came up with, just before

Young ex-architect Kekulé went
looking among the molecules of the time for the hidden
shapes he knew were there, shapes he did not like to think of
as real physical structures, but as “rational formulas,”
showing the relationships that went on in “metamorphoses,”
his quaint 19th-century way of saying “chemical reactions.”
But he could visualize. He saw the four bonds of carbon,
lying in a tetrahedron—he showed how carbon atoms could
link up, one to another, into long chains. . . . But he was
stumped when he got to benzene. He knew there were six
carbon atoms with a hydrogen attached to each one—but he
could not see the shape. Not until the dream: until he was
made to see it, so that others might be seduced by its physical
beauty, and begin to think of it as a blueprint, a basis for new
compounds, new arrangements, so that there would be a field
of aromatic chemistry to ally itself with secular power, and
find new methods of synthesis, so there would be a German
dye industry to become the IG. . .

No: what the Serpent
means is—how’s this—that the six carbon atoms of benzene

“These signs are real. They are also symptoms of a process.
The process follows the same form, the same structure. To
apprehend it you will follow the signs. All talk of cause and
effect is secular history, and secular history is a diversionary
tactic. Useful to you, gentlemen, but no longer so to us here.
If you want the truth—I know I presume—you must look into
the technology of these matters. Even into the hearts of
certain molecules—it is they after all which dictate

Carothers, known as The Great Synthesist.
His classic study of large molecules spanned the decade of the
twenties and brought us directly to nylon, which not only is a
delight to the fetishist and a convenience to the armed
insurgent, but was also, at the time and well within the
System, an announcement of Plasticity’s central canon: that
chemists were no longer to be at the mercy of Nature. They
could decide now what properties they wanted a molecule to
have, and then go ahead and build it. At du Pont, the next step
after nylon was to introduce aromatic rings into the
polyamide chain. Pretty soon a whole family of “aromatic
polymers” had arisen:

for a comparison that Russians might take to, “an extravagant

receptive (he had salesman reflexes, knew to steer
automatically along lines of least indifference) how each
molecule had so many possibilities open to it, possibilities for
bonding, bonds of different strengths, from carbon the most
versatile, the queen, “the Great Catherine of the periodic
