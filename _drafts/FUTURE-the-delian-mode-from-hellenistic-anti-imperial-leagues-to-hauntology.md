- The Delian League
- Federatated democracies (circle back at end with federated computing?)
- Athenian Ideals
- Ze owl
- Athenian tributary and Imperialism
- The Lycian League
- 4 *hundred* years, outlasted any modern democratic nation state.
- Stable federation that didn't become a great power through concequest. A lost future that faded away due to expansionist neighbours
- Longer lasting than modern nation states, and stabler considerin the global calamitoius conflicts that engulfed them in the first half of the 20th Century
- Germany and expansion into neigbhouring democracies that were drawing back into themselves as the imperial project collapsed
- The centre of the hegemon was no longer safe with modern technological developments. With the V2 you could hit the capital regardless of whether the sun ever set on your holdings. There *is* no buffer
- The Blitz
- Delia Derbyshire
- Air-raid sirens, literally growing up in the Blitz
- Turning the sound of facism into the post-war reconstruction civic society
- Now it feels quaint because the civic project was lost with Thatcherism, neolibrealism and New Labour
- Hauntology, lost futures
- Thatcher "There is no alternative"
- Hegemonic instutional self-preservation evaluative structures - "Subject to the Ladder"
- Radiophonic funding killed
- Weave in my aunt recovering a lost piece of Dalek footage that was discarded by the BBC due to funding cuts but with still in the colonial outputs of the ABC archives
- Also people thought synthesised music could be psychological dangerous, weren't sure, legally limited exposure
- It became DANCE MUSIC. Free of content and structured around repition for pure hedonism. (link to Delia's first techno beat)
- The early synths pioneer were often unconventional in social categories
- "The Myths and Legendary Tapes" also basically lost in the digital age when distribution is easy
- Murals and a plamipsest of public civic aspiration
- Lost futures: "It's easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism"
- The end of history (sike)
- The goddamn "apocalypse rave at the end of the world" BBC news audio sting bit
- Delia Debyshire day
- Web 1.0 => 2.0 => 3.0 (which is going great, lol) as the lost futures and fading palimpsest of our digital inscriptions
