The mitochondria (alphaproteobacteria symbionts) and Cytochrome C oxidase as the oxygen 'bomb disposal unit' that allowed prokaroptes to suvive in this environment.  That may have been an archaea, an ancient, that learned to survive the oxygen apocalypse by ingesting a bacteria to make the mitchrondria. 


Cytochrome C oxidase has to steal 4 electrons at once from oxygen, like the reverse of the S-clock in the OEC, because otherwise you make superoxides and other damaging reactive oxygen species.

"These results strongly suggest that bacteria were the first to conquer fully oxygenated niches and that HGTs from them—probably favoured by the tight clustering of components in the genomes—helped the archaea to diversify into a larger range of environments."

"Strikingly, our results indicate that Cyanobacteria also probably replaced their original SUF system (SufBCDSU) by a more complex SufBCDSEA acquired through HGT from Proteobacteria, probably Nitrosomonadales"

"By integrating SufE, a sulfur acceptor that allows accumulation of sulfides, thereby preventing free sulfide from harming cell components, and SufA (ATC-II), a carrier that optimizes Fe–S delivery under oxidative stress, this transfer was probably an asset to fighting oxidative stress. **Therefore, it may have allowed Cyanobacteria to cope with increasing levels of oxygen produced by their own activity, de facto helping the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis**."

^^ This is so important for the "surviving the oxygen apocalypse" story. It's basically the plot point

"Our analyses suggest that, despite thriving in stable and favourable environmental conditions (that is, in absence of oxygen and abundance of iron and sulfur), the LUCA already harboured machineries to carry out Fe–S cluster biogenesis. These results challenge previous hypotheses that stated an emergence of Fe–S cluster biogenesis machineries in response to Earth oxygenation"

"In this view, we hypothesize that the acquisition of a SUF from Proteobacteria early in the evolution of Cyanobacteria brought increased oxygen tolerance in this phylum, thereby favouring the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis."

This is *exactly* the aegis symbiont hypothesis
