This will be a break in style from the other content. It's more like my own mini 33 1/3rd. Myown 11 1/10th?

I was going to open with the forgotten Lycians despite their logentivitiy the "Why has history forgotten a democratic league that lasted longer than all modern city-states and most empires. Is it because history is written as an account of "who conquered who" like the birthing branches of a family tree?"

The the midpoint is the 1000 year Reich/Delia Growing up to air-raid sirens in the biltz.

The palimpsest is the internet centralising to platforms web 1.0 -> web 2.0 -> fake federation of blockchain/crypto and real federated media alteratives. And federation computing being a way forward for scientific computing

-- Conquest -> capital -> empire   it's all about saying that our interconnection, trade, and interdependence *must* be mediated by a monopoly of force centre isn't it?

- The Lycian League
  - Only Hellenestic state to resist the Lydians (led by Croesus, a king so rich his wealth could only be explained by Midas's golden touch creating golden river during washing)
  - Very last territory in Anatolia to be incorporated into the Roman Empire
  - The Delian League under Athenian (the rebellious league was crushed an Lycia had to return fealty to the Persians)
  - 4thC, throw off th eyoke. Perikles organises the provinces revolt against the Satraps
  - Conquered by Alexander the Great
- Amazing art and coinage. Prefected nearby invetions. Cliff tombs and coffins. Own language. 
- Federated democracies (circle back at end with federated computing?)
  - https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230906-the-ancient-civilisation-that-inspired-us-democracy
  - https://www.barnabyrogerson.com/articles-talks/lycia
- Athenian Ideals
- Ze owl
- Athenian tributary and Imperialism
- An anti-Imperial protection league because an Athenian client state -- knlowledge but also war
- 4 *hundred* years, outlasted any modern democratic nation state.
- Stable federation that didn't become a great power through conquest. A lost future that faded away due to expansionist neighbours. History written in terms of wars (get that quote about boys being raised up in a history of war to think it's normal)
- Longer lasting than modern nation states, and stabler considerin the global calamitoius conflicts that engulfed them in the first half of the 20th Century
- OMG the Federalist Papers mentions the Lycian League and contrasts ancient confedarcies vs American Federation
 - In Federalist Papers [9](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed09.asp), [16](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed16.asp), [45](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed45.asp) and held as an example the United States of America being a confederation of states that would not fall to tyranny.
 - Wow the 'Hamilton' connection and the U.S. now electing a demagogue and sliding into tyranny
- America as the isolationist state turning to the 'World's Police' after being drawn into WWII
- Germany and expansion into neigbhouring democracies that were drawing back into themselves as the imperial project collapsed
- The thousand year realm myth
- The centre of the hegemon was no longer safe with modern technological developments. With the V2 you could hit the capital regardless of whether the sun ever set on your holdings. There *is* no buffer
- The Blitz
- Delia Derbyshire
- Maths and physics at Cambridge to make *sounds* not plot the trajectories of bombs
- The Lissajous polynomials, oscilloscopes, sounds, and the ABC logo (rage?).
- Ruby Payne-Scott
- Air-raid sirens, literally growing up in the Blitz
- Turning the sound of fascism into the post-war reconstruction civic society
- Now it feels quaint because the civic project was lost with Thatcherism, neolibrealism and New Labour
- Hauntology, lost futures
- Thatcher "There is no alternative"
- Hegemonic instutional self-preservation evaluative structures - "Subject to the Ladder"
- Radiophonic funding killed
  - It was defunded because it was given 5 years to *break even*
	- Under Blair! New Labour! Neoliberal economics
- Weave in my aunt recovering a lost piece of Dalek footage that was discarded by the BBC due to funding cuts but with still in the colonial outputs of the ABC archives
  - Delia Derbyshire composing the Dr Who theme in a experimental and economically oddball funding of the public broadcaster, meant to make educational and backing sounds and ended up experimental
  - The colonial outposts preserved what the imperial centre discarded.
  - The funding cuts due to neocon government economics.
- Also people thought synthesised music could be psychological dangerous, weren't sure, legally limited exposure
  - literal fear of alternative frequencie
- It became DANCE MUSIC. Free of content and structured around repition for pure hedonism. (link to Delia's [offhand prototehcno track](https://youtu.be/vwQIgGQLOQ8?si=Yf1WghFeNgDIemjQ), first techno beat)
  - I think my take on Dance Music is there's a loss of civic purpose, but also a freedom from narrative and official record. You can just be, dance, exist, have fun, you don't need to *serve a state purpose or national cause*
- The early synths pioneer were often unconventional in social categories
- "The Myths and Legendary Tapes" also basically lost in the digital age when distribution is easy
- Murals and a plamipsest of public civic aspiration
- Lost futures: "It's easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism"
- The end of history (sike)
- The goddamn "apocalypse rave at the end of the world" BBC news audio sting bit
- Delia Debyshire day
- Web 1.0 => 2.0 => 3.0 (which is going great, lol) as the lost futures and fading palimpsest of our digital inscriptions
- Federated Computing in social media, but also in scientific research
- Mention Flux, and avant-garde new computing scheduler, has built in multi-*site* scheduling mechanisms

The imposition of fascism is brought with sound and fury. The drone of buzz bombs, the liftoff of rockets, the orders barked over the top of any sense or objections, the shortwave broadcasts to a captive enraptured audience, the enraged soundbites of sole saviour reposted throughout a social media echochamber, the cheering of crowds promised a triumphant future in front of fake monuments, the piercing wails of air sirens. It was the last that Delia Derbyshire heard the most, growing up in Coventry during the Blitz.
