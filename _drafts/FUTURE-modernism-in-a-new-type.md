Susumua Yakota (1960->2015) and Chinastu Kuzuu (1961->present) are my favourites and should serve as anchor points and emotional core. Kinda like Delia, but there's a broader cast of characters here 

Susumu Yokota? 
Kankyō Ongaku? - Sonic response to a frenetic modernisation. Sonic through line of Japanese natural aesthetics and electronic music
Basically anything on FOND/SOUND
 Late '90s / Early '00s Japanese Ambient Techno and Electronica Mix【 THE NTS GUIDE TO… 】 - https://youtu.be/YPndMPjDfI4?si=n4mkdXYJiuku2cNj
Did this link of SES? Was it the preseve of the educate elite in the reconstructing country?
The Noise Rock scene of Kyoto. I sadly didn't brave going to that venue by myself not speaking the language.
What does it mean to be counter-cultural in a place that has undergone the most rapid cultural shift in history
The rocket of Japan into moderism and the economic miracle of reconstruction protectionism with aid funds and a central bank that will underwrite competitive industries?
Japan and economic capitalist liberal democracy transplanted, subsidised and protected with tarrifs
One trading port of electornics of old war radios become Akihabara (?) check.
An enforced hyperpacificism and curtailed army due to occupation
MITI and the keiretsu system (Zaibatsu gone. Other Asian Tigers similar -- Chaebol)
The overvaluation of Japanese economy and real-estate
Plaza accord to depreciat the US dollar agains the Yen. Low interest rate asset bubble
The Lost Decades. Literal decades of if you bought stock on the Nikkei in Japan from 1989 (check exact date) you *only just* would have broke even from the lossses now
Stagnation yet hyper overwork
Sony and the hidden deal to start the Playstation when SEGA reneged on their CD drive deal
The Asian characters ASCII code equivalent for the new East Asian computing industry (Shift JIS)
CODING without the Latin alphabet
-> Competition, porting, localisation, competing standards until UTF-8 and Unicode
A complete empire collapse to an isolationist nation rebuild
-> Pankaj Mishra ("From the Ruins of Empire")
-> Let's also not erase the humanitarian atrocities of Imperial Japan
The Shinkansen, a project so costly and difficult that the director was forced to resign
Regardless of the cost, the *national capability* unlocked became outstanding
But then it was there, and he was right, and he's now venerated as a hero
The weird economics of the JR anyway. Peter paying Paul but in a way that *serves the people*
Hypermodern living in a hyperdense life
Japanese websites like they are from 1997 (Why?) Still functional and serving even if not "modern UX"
Chinastu Kuuzu doing Enlgish Poetry (The Lady of Shallot, The Raven, The City in the Sea)
Midori Takada
And videogame soundtracks. Videogames soundstracks were serious respectable music (Soichi Terada)
City Pop! (Plastic Love) 
Japanese Jazz (Ryo Fukui) and piano (Ryuichi Sakamoto)
Yellow Magic Orchestra
The algo resurfaces this
- I'll find some much if I do digging into this essay idea
- Anime and Manga as an cultural answer to some of the questions below
- Cultural exports thriving while domestic economy stagnates. (I want to stick to music)

1940s->1990s Japanese cultural changes myust have been one of the most rapid in all of history. But I have no lived experience and don't want to write as if I have perspective there.

What does it cost to participate in a technological ecosystem designed around someone else's alphabet?

What does it cost to participate in an economic system designed around someone else's culture?

What does it cost to participate in a globalised world design around someone else's lingua franca?

What does it mean to be seen by the world to be in the future while clinging to your past? (Shinto, family systems)
