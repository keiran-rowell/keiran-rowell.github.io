```python

import sys

print("Hello world!")
```

```julia

println("Hello world!")
```

Julia is designed to hit sweet-spot of easy to write and performance for scientific code, so muich so that there's now a full production quality [Quantum Chemistry package written in Julia](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00337). 

```rust

fn main() {
    println!("Hello world!");
}
```
