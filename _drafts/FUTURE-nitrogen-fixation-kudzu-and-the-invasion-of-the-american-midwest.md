*Nitrogen fixations is a subject I was taught about ever since highschool chemistry, where the [Haber process](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Equilibria/Le_Chateliers_Principle/The_Haber_Process) was [part of the ciricullum on equilibria](https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/11-12/stage-6-learning-areas/stage-6-science/chemistry-2017/content/2267) . The most influential book on this post is [The Alchemy of Air](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/73464/the-alchemy-of-air-by-thomas-hager-author-of-the-demon-under-the-microscope/), which details the life of Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, particularly during WWII when the Germany producing its own supply of NH<sub>3</sub> was **critical** to continuing the war since they were blockaded from accessing overseas ammonia that was needed for fertiliser and munitions. 

Carl Bosch was an industrialist unafraid to apply the highest pressures and the wildest materials in the search for a new catalyst. Despite guiding the German chemical conglomerates in 1930s that provided German chemical supplies in WWII (BASF and Bayer were denazified and thrive to this day). Bosch was removed from his positions for speaking up against anti-semitism as the Nazis began to dictate industry. Fritz Haber was zealously loyal to imperial Germany, developing many horrific chemical warfare gases; a loyalty that horrified his pacifist wife who took her own life following his battlefield gas attacks, and ended up meaning nothing to the ascendant Nazi regime that attempted to erase his legacy because he was Jewish. Bosh and Haber were also involved in the early pushes for a synthetic dye industry (a subject for a later post).*

### N‚â°N: The strongest bond in the air 


N<sub>2</sub> chemistry stuff

General Lewis structure. 

Maybe some brief MO theory. Only if it's enlightening. 

### N‚â°N + ‚ö°: the Promethean way to free nitrogen


Hydro electricity in Norway. Norway's abundant hydro power is being [leveraged to this day to generate renewable energy](https://www.energy-storage.news/freyr-secures-renewable-power-supply-from-statkraft-for-first-two-gigafactories/) (disclosure: I have an investment in Freyr because I think the enterprise is  a good thing for the world). 

The production of artificial lightning used to sever N‚â°N apart. 

Hitler's aim to seize the Vemork hydro plant for its heavy water side-product needed to build the atomic bomb. 

This operation is portrayed in the Norwegian TV series [The Heavy Water War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3280150/).


### N‚â°N + üóúÔ∏è: the brute force way to make NH<sub>3</sub> that's used to this day


The Haber process.

Intense pressures, catalyst, and risk of being bombed. 

The Haber process in use today.

### üê¶ + üí©: white gold of the seas

Germany blocked from reaching bird poop. 

American guano island seizure laws.

The [war for Chincha guano islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chincha_Islands_War). Hard labour is still performed to extract Guano from the droppings of 4 million birds on Peruvian islands, [stacked in giant sacks among the throng of cormorants](https://www.audubon.org/news/holy-crap-trip-worlds-largest-guano-producing-islands).

Australia's administration of the Nauru guano islands (the third smallest country in the world). Nauru is now used by the Australian government for an offshore immigration processing centre under Australia's [controversial indefinite detention laws](https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/projects/immigration-detention-and-human-rights). 


### N‚â°N + ü¶†: the organic way to fertilise soil 

Nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria

Symbiotic with the root nodules in legumes.

*E.g* giant Rhubarb and blue-green algae [include photo from Tassie botanic gardens]()


### üåø Kudzu and the overrun of the American south 

Kudzu growth was so efficient in the south it engulfed entire settlements, as captured in eerie quiescence of [R.E.M's debut album cover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c0/R.E.M._-_Murmur.jpg). 

Kudzu's onward march is unstoppable, and [the Midwest is set to be next](https://thehill.com/homenews/4025176-midwest-primed-to-be-next-frontier-for-invasive-plant-kudzu/).


### Attempts to create artificial Nitrogen-fixing catalysts

Traditional catalysts

Directed mutagenesis
