Xenon --- the perfect drug we can't afford to trigger an effect we don't understand with substances that should be chemically inert

We've been using it since the 1940s. 
We haven't even had any structural data to argue over until 3--4 years ago!

- Just as we're getting dependable structural data, nuclear spin and interactions with radical pairs have been proposed to come in to play

This is an unsolved mystery so keep it a short one and keep it tight

Removing our *very consciousness* from supposedly *inert elements*. Suppressing what we cannot explain through chemical mechanisms we do not understand. But it just takes a huff!

Xe fractionally distilled from the tiny fraction in the air.

Xe not approved as an anesthetic by the FDA, only used in EU.

Nitrogen narcosis -- I believe this is how it was discovered??
Measured as: Meyer-Overton correlation grap 

Orch-OR and quantum conciousness

- Kr and Ar need to be hyperbaric concentrations (7 and 27 bar!!)

- Only a small porion got the that cavities in constrast to prior studies
- Most atom positions are the in crystal contacts between molecules, artefacts of the xtalisation process
- All the Membrance Protein Kr/Ar positions can be reproduced by MD
- They posit it's the supression of membrane dynamics. Whether is this enough I dunno

[Nuclear Spin Attenuates the Anesthetic Potency of Xenon Isotopes in Mice: Implications for the Mechanisms of Anesthesia and Consciousness](https://rdcu.be/eYvJF) Potency of Xe-129 a& Xe-121 is less than spinless Xe-132 and Xe-134. What?? Coooll But what?
