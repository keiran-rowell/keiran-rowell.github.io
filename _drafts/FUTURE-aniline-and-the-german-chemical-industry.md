*I'm aiming to give a broad-strokes overview of how near-infinite array of colours we see in textiles today was wrought from some the of most murky carbon substances known. This post will focus on purple (specifically, mauveine). I'd like to more on specific dyes in the future because they have so many fascination properties, like how indigo forms from the dimer of the common indole group in biochemistry, placing it within striking distance of tryophan in the biosynthetic pathway.*

![Indigo biosynthesis in plants](../images/indole_metabolism_in_plants.png)

Indigo is made from joining two slighly modified indole molecules. Indole is such a common structure in biology that it is used to make typtophan, one of the 20 standard amino acids, which can reveal protein folding properties through fluorescence.   [Synthesis diagram from *Plant Cell Reports*, Volume 35, pages 2449–2459, **(2016)**].

*The development of dyes used to be covered in a (rarely taught) NSW syllabus option, "Chemistry of Art", which is sadly gone. For those interested in colour more generally, I can recommend "The Secret Lives of Colour" for its addictive ability pick-up and dive into each hue, and "The History of Colour" for an academic history (Chapter 2 starts with synthetic purple and details the explosion in commerically valuabled colour that followed). as a fun book to have in your life. If the industrial dye developments interests you, BASF have well produced and comprehensive account of their entire history [on their website](https://www.basf.com/global/en/who-we-are/history/chronology/1865-1901.html).*

### Born in the purple 🟣

- The value of purple throughout ancient civilisations

### Pauvre mauve 🪻

- Really poor subsitutes for sea-creature purple
- Need to discover one of the most fundemental secrets in organic (carbon-based) chemistry 

### The daydream snake 🐍♻️♾️ and the invention of chemical "Aromaticity" and "Resonance" ⌬

- Kekulé

Aromaticity (a terrible misnomer, as with most chemical nomenclature, from a generalisation that first few observed substances were strong smelling) 

Resonance  -- a terrible misnomer, as with most chemical nomenclature, because molecular nuclei do *not* 'resonate' between two separate resonance structures ([as many of the original theorists well knew, though confusion rose rapidly due partly to sloppy exposition by Pauling in a campaign to expand the conceptual basis of structural chemistry.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4027968)). 

A vocal minority of Soviet scientists [viewed the resonance concept as fictitious mathematical idealisation that was antithetical to dialectal materialism](https://www.jstor.org/stable/227752), so the state adopted a terminological slight of hand to avoid referring to resonance or using 'resonance structures' as a teaching aid.  

 
### Muckracking ⚗️

- Perkin and the dye industry

- The search for a cheap route to quinine to treat malaria 
- The search for cheap feedstocks

### Coal tarred 🪨 and feathered

- BASF - *Badische Anilin und Sodafabrik* (Baden Aniline and Sodium Carbonate Factory). The rise of this company was meteoric after [Haber and Bosch invented their method]({% post_url 2023-06-14-nitrogen-fixation.md %}) to turn nitrogen from the air into fertiliser. The sodafabrik part of BASF is infamous of New South Wales highschool students who had to memorise the conditions of the Solvay process as part of their Industrial Chemistry module.

Gravity's Rainbow qoute

Kekulé serpentine solution of benzene's structure is actually within the book Gravity's Rainbow as a metaphor the economic boon that destructive cycle of WWII war economy brings:
> “Kekulé dreams the Great Serpent holding its own tail in its mouth, the dreaming Serpent which surrounds the World. But the meanness, the cynicism with which this dream is to be used. The Serpent that announces, “The World is a closed thing, cyclical, resonant, eternally-returning,” is to be delivered into a system whose only aim is to violate the Cycle. Taking and not giving back, demanding that “productivity” and “earnings” keep on increasing with time, the System removing from the rest of the World these vast quantities of energy to keep its own tiny desperate fraction showing a profit: and not only most of humanity—most of the World, animal, vegetable, and mineral, is laid waste in the process... No return, no salvation, no Cycle—that’s not what They, nor Their brilliant employee Kekulé, have taken the Serpent to mean. No: what the Serpent means is—how’s this—that the six carbon atoms of benzene are in fact curled around into a closed ring, just like that snake with its tail in its mouth, GET IT?"

I.G. Farben (very literally, "The Colour Syndicate") is a constant ominous industrial spectre stalking Gravity's Rainbow because, tragically, these scientifically and commercially pioneering chemical companies were wrested into the control of depraved, horrific warmongers; the 'Them' of the military-industrial complex which stalks the book's entire narrative.

### What goes on in the electronics of dyes ⚛️ 

- Dyes are still a testbed for theoretical chemistry. Like revisiting the [classic green and red dyes](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp309006e)
- Some of Seth Olsen's papers amongst others, link back to GFP chromophores etc?  
- The composition of dyes in ancient artefacts are still an object of study (link to the Blue & Purple dyes chemistry paper).
