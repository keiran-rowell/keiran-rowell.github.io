*I'm aiming to give a broad-strokes overview of how near-infinite array of colours we see in textiles today was wrought from some the of most murky carbon substances known. This post will focus on purple (specifically, mauveine). I'd like to more on specific dyes in the future because they have so many fascination properties, like how indigo forms from the dimer of the common indole group in biochemistry, placing it within striking distance of tryophan in the biosynthetic pathway.*

![Indigo biosynthesis in plants](../images/indole_metabolism_in_plants.png)

Indigo is made from joining two slighly modified indole molecules. Indole is such a common structure in biology that it is used to make typtophan, one of the 20 standard amino acids, which can reveal protein folding properties through fluorescence.   [Synthesis diagram from *Plant Cell Reports*, Volume 35, pages 2449‚Äì2459, **(2016)**].

*The development of dyes used to be covered in a (rarely taught) NSW syllabus option, "Chemistry of Art", which is sadly gone. For those interested in colour more generally, I can recommend* ["The Secret Lives of Colour"](https://www.kassiastclair.com/books) *for its addictive ease to pick-up and dive into each hue, and* ["The History of Colour"](https://www.rca.ac.uk/more/staff/neil-parkinson/) *for an academic history of the conception of colour (Chapter 2 starts with synthetic purple and details the explosion in commerically valuable tints that followed). If the industrial dye developments interests you, BASF have well produced and comprehensive account of their entire history [on their website](https://www.basf.com/global/en/who-we-are/history/chronology/1865-1901.html).*

### Born in the purple üü£

- The value of purple throughout ancient civilisations
- Roman's purple togas, created from single drop secretions of sea creatures. Such and important symbol and class and political status that under some reigns you could be put to death for improperly wearing purple. 
- Recent study published in *Chemical Society Reviews* on ["The invention of blue and purple pigments in ancient times"](https://doi.org/10.1039/B606268G)
- Ancient East and South Asian uses of purple (from the above)

### Pauvre mauve ü™ª

- Really poor subsitutes for sea-creature purple
- Ironically, despite the incredibly rarity of steadfast purple in nature, purple's was the first and entirely accidental synthetic hue 
- Needed to discover one of the most fundemental secrets in organic (carbon-based) chemistry to unlock synthetic purple

### The daydream snake üêç‚ôªÔ∏è‚ôæÔ∏è and the invention of chemical "Aromaticity" and "Resonance" ‚å¨

- Kekul√©

Gravity's Rainbow qoute

Kekul√© serpentine solution of benzene's structure is actually within the book Gravity's Rainbow as a metaphor the economic boon that destructive cycle of WWII war economy brings:
> ‚ÄúKekul√© dreams the Great Serpent holding its own tail in its mouth, the dreaming Serpent which surrounds the World. But the meanness, the cynicism with which this dream is to be used. The Serpent that announces, ‚ÄúThe World is a closed thing, cyclical, resonant, eternally-returning,‚Äù is to be delivered into a system whose only aim is to violate the Cycle. Taking and not giving back, demanding that ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù and ‚Äúearnings‚Äù keep on increasing with time, the System removing from the rest of the World these vast quantities of energy to keep its own tiny desperate fraction showing a profit: and not only most of humanity‚Äîmost of the World, animal, vegetable, and mineral, is laid waste in the process... No return, no salvation, no Cycle‚Äîthat‚Äôs not what They, nor Their brilliant employee Kekul√©, have taken the Serpent to mean. No: what the Serpent means is‚Äîhow‚Äôs this‚Äîthat the six carbon atoms of benzene are in fact curled around into a closed ring, just like that snake with its tail in its mouth, GET IT?"

- Aromaticity (a terrible misnomer, as with most chemical nomenclature, from a generalisation that first few observed substances were strong smelling) 
- Add some history of why it was called aromaticity (scientist names). Talk about how aromatic 'sections' of molecules give them some of their most interesting chemical behaviour
- Resonance  -- a terrible misnomer, as with most chemical nomenclature, because molecular nuclei do *not* 'resonate' between two separate resonance structures ([as many of the original theorists well knew, though confusion rose rapidly due partly to sloppy exposition by Pauling in a campaign to expand the conceptual basis of structural chemistry.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4027968)).
- Figure of benzene "resonance contributors" and the true delocalised dashed line ring version 
- The Soviet opposition to resonance. The term mesomerism occasionally making an appearance instead.  
A vocal minority of Soviet scientists [viewed the resonance concept as fictitious mathematical idealisation that was antithetical to dialectal materialism](https://www.jstor.org/stable/227752), so the state adopted a terminological slight of hand to avoid referring to resonance or using 'resonance structures' as a teaching aid.  

 
### Muckracking ‚öóÔ∏è

- Perkin and the dye industry
[Perkin and Hofmann](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1896/ct/ct8966900596)
- The search for a cheap route to quinine to treat malaria 
- The search for cheap feedstocks

### Coal tarred ü™® and feathered

- BASF - *Badische Anilin und Sodafabrik* (Baden Aniline and Sodium Carbonate Factory). The rise of this company was meteoric after [Haber and Bosch invented their method]({% post_url 2023-06-14-nitrogen-fixation.md %}) to turn nitrogen from the air into fertiliser. The sodafabrik part of BASF is infamous of New South Wales highschool students who had to memorise the conditions of the Solvay process as part of their Industrial Chemistry module.
- Known as the [Aniline women](https://www.basf.com/global/images/about-us/history/21252221_BRO_Anilinerinnen_englisch_final.pdf.assetdownload.pdf)
- BASF would go on to join I.G. Farben (very literally, "The Colour Syndicate"), a cartel appearing as a constant ominous industrial spectre stalking Gravity's Rainbow, tragically mirroring how these scientifically and commercially pioneering chemical companies were wrested into the control of depraved, horrific warmongers; the 'Them' of the military-industrial complex which haunts the book's entire narrative.
- The effects on fashion 
- The societal implications
- Medicine 


### What goes on in the electronics of dyes ‚öõÔ∏è 

- Huckel's rule for aromaciticty: any cyclic arrangement of 4*n*+2 carbon atoms, where electrons are "shared" between all atoms in the ring, *n*=1,2,3...  
- Figure of Huckel aromotacity and delocalised pi cloud 
- Dyes are still a testbed for theoretical chemistry. Like revisiting the [classic green and red dyes](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp309006e)
- Some of Seth Olsen's papers amongst others
- Link back to GFP chromophores etc?  
- The composition of dyes in ancient artefacts are still an object of study (link to the Blue & Purple dyes chemistry paper).
