#Title: From Muck to Mauve - Analine and the Birth of the German Chemical Industry

> Content notice: this post discusses the growth of German chemical industrial conglomerates following chemical discoveries in the 19th Century. Sadly these industries were being put to horrific under Nazi leadership during WWII. However, the focus on this post is chemical history along the process of turning fossil fuels into dyes.

### The daydream snake and the birth of "Aromaticity"

-- Kekulé

Aromaticity (a terrible misnomer, as with most chemical nomenclature, from a generalisation that first few observed substances were strong smelling) 

Resonance  -- a terrible misnomer, as with most chemical nomenclature, because molecular nuclei do *not* 'resonate' between two separate resonance structures ([as many of the original theorists well knew, though confusion rose rapidly due partly to sloppy exposition by Pauling in a campaign to expand the conceptual basis of structural chemistry.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4027968)). 

Gravity's Rainbow qoute

Kekulé serpentine solution of benzene's structure is actually within the book Gravity's Rainbow as a metaphor the economic boon that destructive cycle of WWII war economy brings:
> “Kekulé dreams the Great Serpent holding its own tail in its mouth, the dreaming Serpent which surrounds the World. But the meanness, the cynicism with which this dream is to be used. The Serpent that announces, “The World is a closed thing, cyclical, resonant, eternally-returning,” is to be delivered into a system whose only aim is to violate the Cycle. Taking and not giving back, demanding that “productivity” and “earnings” keep on increasing with time, the System removing from the rest of the World these vast quantities of energy to keep its own tiny desperate fraction showing a profit: and not only most of humanity—most of the World, animal, vegetable, and mineral, is laid waste in the process... No return, no salvation, no Cycle—that’s not what They, nor Their brilliant employee Kekulé, have taken the Serpent to mean. No: what the Serpent means is—how’s this—that the six carbon atoms of benzene are in fact curled around into a closed ring, just like that snake with its tail in its mouth, GET IT?"

IG Farben is a constant ominous industrial spectre stalking Gravity's Rainbow becuase of the throughline from chemical understanding of benzene to the coal tar dye industry and then eventually Nazi German's horrific experiments with warfare gas. 

A vocal minority of Soviet scientists [viewed the resonance concept as fictitious mathematical idealisation that was antithetical to dialectal materialism](
https://www.jstor.org/stable/227752), so the state adopted a terminological slight of hand to avoid referring to resonance or using 'resonance structures' as a teaching aid.

Dyes are still a testbed for theoretical chemistry. Like revisiting the [classic green and red dyes](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp309006e)
