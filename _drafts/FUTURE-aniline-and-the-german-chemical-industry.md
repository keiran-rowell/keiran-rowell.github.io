### The daydream snake and the birth of "Aromaticity"

-- KekulÃ©

Aromaticity (a terrible misnomer, as with most chemical nomenclature, from a generalisation that first few observed substances were strong smelling) 

Resonance  -- a terrible misnomer, as with most chemical nomenclature, because molecular nuclei do *not* 'resonate' between two separate resonance structures ([as many of the original theorists well knew, though confusion rose rapidly due partly to sloppy exposition by Pauling in a campaign to expand the conceptual basis of structural chemistry.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4027968)). 

A vocal minority of Soviet scientists [viewed the resonance concept as fictitious mathematical idealisation that was antithetical to dialectal materialism](
https://www.jstor.org/stable/227752), so the state adopted a terminological slight of hand to avoid referring to resonance or using 'resonance structures' as a teaching aid.
