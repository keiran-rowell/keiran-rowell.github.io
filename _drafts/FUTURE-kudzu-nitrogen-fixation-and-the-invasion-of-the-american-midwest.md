Recommend the Alchemy of Air, which tells the tortuted tale of Fritz Haber in greater depth than the HSC. Also talk about how nitrogen fixation was so hard, the only man-made way to do it was to break the Nâ‰¡N by generating artificial lightning in a chamber. Only the Norwegians had the ability to do that using the energy from their immense hydro powerplant. Indicidentally this hydro powerplant was also the only source of heavy water D<sub>2</sub>O, which instigated the [Heavy Water War]() where Hilter siezed Norway, Quisling collaborated, and the Norwegians in exile had to send crack ski troops to blow up Norway's own powerplant.
