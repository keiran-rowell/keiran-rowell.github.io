It's just smoke. Go on, you know I can't say no*

## Make this a 10 min mark one, don't cover *everything* 

-> Through line "From Hell, life". Geothermal life. Silician Mafia. Cystines keeping proteins together. Sulfur atmospheric conditions taking it away. Crop failure from sulfate clouds, though H2SO4 needed in fertiliser.  

A story of commodity value inversion. What caused wars is now sold to be *taken away*. If the petroleum industry shrinks it might invert again
 
Indonesian Sulfur mines with Blue Flames

Gunpowder
Fertiliser 
Sicily Sulfur wars
-> Strongly associated with the rise of the Sicilian Mafia
-> Carusi -- Child labour, hellish work. Buckateer 
-> Movie 'La discesa di Aclà a Floristella' [Alca's descent into Floristella](https://youtu.be/p_4abqpxlZs?si=HDjE8h_DK9Ax19SV)

Sulfur in the Byzantine Greek Fire

BBC New article [Sulphur surplus: Up to our necks in a diabolical element](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28369829)

> "I am not prepared just now to say to what extent I believe in a physical hell in the next world, but a sulfur mine in Sicily is about the nearest thing to hell that I expect to see in this life."

Rubber Vulcanisation

London "Great Smog of 1952" Photochemical Smog
The 1816 "Year Without Summer" from eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia. Crop failures and food shortgages half way across the world. Sulfate aerosol levels.

Byproduct of the petroleoum refining process.

I also think Sulfur is actually sold for negative value -- so much excess if produced that industrial manufactures pay people to take sulfur
Sulfur mountains

But if we stopped using fossil fuels entirerly will there be a dearth of sulfur?

Sulfur containing ship fuel. Acts as a global *coolant* but SOx is so toxic in the atmosphere it needs to be banned

H2SO4 production - Contact Process

Sulfur S8 "crowns"?

Pigments: vermillion/cinnabar, ultramarine's S₃⁻ radical (cross-link to purple post section heading) 

Sulfur "eating" microbes - reduction to H2S

Sulfur-Ion clusters in electron transport? Thermal vents. Was primitive life really about getting the electron transport chain working?
There's something almost mythical about underwater brimstone cauldrons being the origins of us all/

[Penam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penam) as an antibiotic class

Geothermal vents

Mustard gas?

Cystine and protein stability

## Open on the geothermal vent and sulfur eating life. Heat + energy + sulfur can be metabolism [image of hydrothermal vent]. BILLIONS OF YEARS OLDER THAN PHOTOSYNTHESIS *a couple of sentences setting up the smash cut to modern day humans surrounded by blue fire*
## Open again on the blue fire of Indonesian suflur mines. (Humans not microbes) [image of blue fire]
4 billion years later, well above the sulfur-eating sea creatures that still cluster around deep-sea vents, Idonesian miners descend into volcano Ijen to start their work. 
## Move on to the Carusi and the Silician Sulfur mines. (Human societal exploitation) [painting of carusi]
"This hell is not new. Mining brimstone fueled the growth of one of humanity's most notorious organisations --- the Silician Mafia"
## Gunpowder and Greek Fire. (Human destruction in warfare) [ancient illustration of Greek Fire]
## Industrial demand (Vulcanisation) then the great economic inversion (S as petroleum byproduct people *pay* to get taken away). [image of modern day S yellow waste mounts] Even if H2SO4 is one of the most produced industrial chemicals and needed for fertiliser. 
## Natural disasters take away biological life London Smog, Year Without Summer [image of London Smog]
## Biochemistry -- now reveal Fe-S clusters as the fundamental primeval electron harvest unit. They were the origin but they're *still* essential and unchanged. Proteins stabled together with disulfide bridges in Cysteine. [Protein structure illustration]
