*In this post I'm aiming to give a broad-brush overview of how near-infinite array of colours we see in textiles today was wrought from some of the most murky carbon substances known. This post will focus on* <span style="color:rebeccapurple">purple</span> (specifically, <span style="color:#8D029B">mauveine</span>) *but will meander through the history and chemistry of the blue hues.* 

*I'd like to more on specific dyes in the future because they have so many fascinating chemical properties. For example,* <span style="color:indigo">indigo</span> *forms from a dimer using the indole group common in biochemistry, placing it within striking distance of tryptophan (amino acid $$W$$) in the biosynthetic pathway.*

Indigo is made from joining two slighly modified indole molecules. Indole is such a common structure in biology that it is used to make typtophan, one of the 20 standard amino acids, which can reveal protein folding properties through fluorescence. ---Synthesis diagram from *Plant Cell Reports*, 35, [pg. 2449–2459](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00299-016-2046-3), **(2016)**.

### Pauvre mauve 🪻

There's an abundance of green in the natural world (likely because plant chlorophyll is [tuned for reliable photosynthesis](https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-are-plants-green-to-reduce-the-noise-in-photosynthesis-20200730/)), but blues and purples stick out because they are so [rare in nature](https://set.adelaide.edu.au/news/list/2019/08/20/why-is-the-colour-blue-so-rare-in-nature). Maybe that's why blue is [humanity's favourite colour](https://au.yougov.com/international/articles/12336-why-blue-worlds-favorite-color-1). The rare examples of natural blue are unsual --- bird and butterfly wings have to restort to optical trickery (metamaterials); blueberries get their name and antioxidant health craze because their skin packed with the crop pigment [anthocynanin](https://en.wikipediea.org/wiki/Anthocyanin); and the blue skin of the poison dart frog is from the very same chemical that makes it poisonous (pumiliotoxin); and lobsters change spectacularly from blue to red upon boiling due to heat denaturing [crustacyanin](https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201501609).

![Anthocyanin skeleton](/images/anthocyanidine_320-228.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

Almost all these colours in the blue end of the spectrum (and others) are pigmnets built from the anthocyanidin skeleton shown above. ---*Wikimedia Commons*, [NEUROtiker, 5 August 2008](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Anthocyanidine.svg). 
{:.figcaption}

Similarly, there's an almost complete abscence of natural purple. Purple cabbage and eggplant contain the same anthocyanins as blueberries, similary for violets flowers whose colour maybe be striking but are not colourfast when used to dye fabric. So, when nature was our only source of chemicals, people's desire the wear the spectrum of 'cool' colours was met by crushing the leaves of the somewhat drab <span style="color:#7B99B0">woad,</span> and the perennially popular indigo --- the name of both the plant and one of Newton's seven 'ROYGB**I**V' colours. 

The only concentrated, colourfast sources of organic purple come from the seas. *Aplysia* sea slugs [spray purple](https://youtu.be/qmn1bpz00qA?si=ajvqjlsCp7IaI25-) aplysioviolin molecules when threatened, which build up from eating red algea; stripping the colourant molecule from the algae's light harvesting proteins and concentrating this aplysioviolin derivative within the seahare's ink glands. A painstaking, but more reliable, way to obtain natural purple is to extract ink glands from the *Murex* sea snail. The 'Tyrian purple' dye harvested from these snail glands was, and is, [outrageously expensive](https://youtu.be/IVXqisH6VeM?si=mRh5GDGBscIPJDDH), fetching around $3,000 USD/g in the 21st century. Tyrian purple is in fact a brominated derivative of indigo, synthesised using a bromoperoxidase enzyme unique to *Murex*. Scientists still have not confirmed the active metal within the *Murex*'s bromoperoxidase enzyme (most bromoperoxidases use the rare Vanadium), or which gene in the sea snail encodes for this purple producing enzyme. 

### Lapis lazuli and other blues of value 🔵

For making paints and dyes, even the colour diversity found within the minerals of the Earth was of little help; the naturally occuring mineral pigments are prone to dull hues, rapid fading, and discolouration into green (*e.g.* azurite). Synthetic mineral blue dyeswere created in ancient times from copper silicates (mixed with calcium - "Egyptian Blue", or barium - "Han Blue & Purple"), or otherwise just from indigo 'baked into' a mineral substrate, as detailed in a in *Chemical Society Reviews* article on ["The invention of blue and purple pigments in ancient times"](https://doi.org/10.1039/B606268G). However, Han Purple did not provide a pure purple, but its appearance due to red copper oxide impurities. Similarly, pure, brilliant blue mineral pigment was only provided by eye wateringly expensive lapis lazuli (ultarmarine), mined only around the mountains on the North-Eastern tip of Afghanistan. Ultramarine would cost up to 100x other pigments, but its dazzling effect was valued in relgious iconography across Asia and Europe, and has notable use in famous paintings (*e.g.* the [blue headscarf](https://heritagesciencejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40494-020-00364-5) in *"Girl with a Pearl Earring"*). Since mineral pigments and synthetics paled in comparison to "true" ultramarine, lapis lazuli was in demand well into the 19th century. The physical origin of the intense blue appearance of ultramarine is chemically interesting: rather than a metal at the centre of the mineral, the colour comes instead from a negatively charged trisulfur radical (S$$_3^{.-}$$).

Now with modern chemistry, blue hues can be made that are so striking that an artist can make a multimillionair dollar name for themselves with [one famous blue dye](https://www.invaluable.com/blog/yves-klein-blue/), and scientific careers and reputations can be built upon chemists' prowess to manufacture the [bluest blue](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/quantum-blue-berkeley_n_5b8db0a4e4b0511db3db33a1). The chemistry to produce commercially abundant purple dyes was however only cracked in the 19th century, and with it opened up new possiblities in organic synthesis. Even now, there is unplumbed depths to these cool hues: the colour terminology for purple and violet is murky, our [visual perception](https://jakubmarian.com/difference-between-violet-and-purple/) strains near the UV wavelengths, and even the [colour range](https://ericportis.com/posts/2024/okay-color-spaces/) of our computer monitors come up short. 
 

### Porphyrogeniture 👑

Purple has [long signified royalty and power in the ancient world](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-4469.2008.00097.x), to the point that its use was restricted to high office; not just due to the expense of natural purple dye, but often enforced by social codes and law. Famously, Roman officials would colour their formal attire (togas) with a strip of purple along the border. This style, the *toga praetexta* (from Preator, a magistrate position below Consul) wasn't solely restricted to appointed officials, but likely had a religious origin and was recored as being worn by priests and [pre-adolescent children of fortunate birth](https://www.jstor.org/stable/693055). However, a toga fully clad in purple become restricted to Roman consuls and generals performing a Triumph, and later to the Emperor alone. Nero limits the use of purple to the imperial court, and the unsanctioned wearing of purple was even [codified as an offence punishable by death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Theodosianus) by Theodosius II. 

The association of the purple hue with royalty extended beyond clothing, and Byzantine (Eastern Roman) queens would give birth to future rulers in rooms decorated with a deep-purple Imperal Porphyry stone (from Ancient Greek *porphyra* - purple). This birthright to distinction through colour was enforced from cradle to grave, as [Emperors were buried in tombs made from porphyry](https://www.pallasweb.com/deesis/imperial-porphyry-tombs.html), some [survive today outside the Archealogical Museum in Instanbul](/images/porphyry_tomb.jpg). The purple name echoes throughout history, such as the sisters [Zoe](/images/zoe_porphyrogenita.jpg) and Theodora Porphyrogenita who co-ruled the Byzantine empire after a popular revolt. 

### Born in the purple 🟣 

Ironically, despite the incredibly rarity of steadfast purple in nature, purple was the first in a tidal wave of synthetic industrial dyes, bringing the colour to the masses causing it to become commonplace and unfashionable in quickly after reaching the mass market. The discovery of artifical purple dye (mauvine) was entirely accidentally, but the chemical knowledge to synthesise at massive scale required unravelling some of the fundemental mysteries in organic (carbon-based) chemistry, and clarification about how electrons create molecular structure and govern the interactions of dye molecules with light.  


The first artifical purple dye was synthesised by William Henry Perkin in 1856, an entirely accidental side discovery. Perkin's motivation was no econcolouration, but empire. What Perkin was searching for was a cheap synthetic route to quinine, an antimarial substance isolated from cinchoa tree bark) that was useful for soldiers stationed in colonies of the British Empire. Perkin's synthesis attempts were misguided from the start, having only the quinine's empirical formula (C$$_{20}$$H$$_{24}$$N$$_{2}$$O$$_{2}$$) and no idea of its structure he thought he could explored combining two equivalents of organic stating material that would sum to the total atom count of quinine once oxygenated. In reality, quinine the source of [tonic water's ultraviolet glow under black light](/images/tonic_water_UV_Paul_Garland.jpg), has complex strained structure which set of [150 years of investigation and controversy into its difficult synthesis](TODO: cite syntehsis of quinine wikipedia page). What Perkin found instead was that on diluting his failed synthesis product with alcohol on wash-up the solution turned purple. He opened up a dyeworks in Greenford the next year. The success of a synthetic dyes would lead to a [complete collapse of the economic harvesting of natural dyes such as madder root](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43427950). 

![Sample of Perkin's mauve aniline dye](/images/perkins_mauve_sample.jpg){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

Perkin's mauve was a runaway success but through its overuse in fashion it came to be see as tawdry. and the use of the gaudy colour fell out of favour for everyday wear. --—*Journal of the Society of Dyers and Colourists*, Nov. **1906**, *via* the [Science History Insitute](https://digital.sciencehistory.org/works/o2sfuyr) . 
{:.figcaption}

However, Perkin's happy discovery at 18 years old started from his encouraged experiment with the idea of synthesis quinine when [working as assitant to his advisor August Wilhelm von Hofmann](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1896/ct/ct8966900596). Perkin continued his experiments out of the lab, and on his own property, in order to trial creating proper dyes. The raw organic feedstock to make these dyes had become available at an commercial scale due to experiments in organic synthesis and industrial processes to make flammable gas from coal tar. Though unlocking amazing synthesis routes, Perkin, Hofmann and chemists were working on organic materials withouth knowing their true atomitic connectivity. They were deemeed "aromatic" compounds due to a few representative molecules that reacted in similar ways having a strong smell (*e.g.* benzoin, in incense), but their molecular structure was a puzzle from their empirical formulae and reactivities.

### Muckracking ⚗️
Coal tar's shimmering opacity hides its chemical complexity, containing thousands of hydrocarbons compounds it was the major source of complex carbon backbones for the synthesis of organic molecules. August Wilhelm von Hofmann was one of the pioneers in these experiments, who is considered by science historians to by one of the ["fathers of synthetic chemistry"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/anie.199212653) (he and Jamacian born chemist John Blyth were the first to use the term "synthesis" in a publication)
Hofmann's interest can be seen in by the title of his first publication in 1843 [*"Chemische Untersuchung der organischen Basen im
Steinkohlen-Theeroel"*](https://doi.org/10.1002/jlac.18430470106) ("Chemical Investigation of the Organic Bases in Coal-Tar Oil"). Hofmann was to isolate both aniline (the basis for dyes, mauvine was also called "aniline purple") and quinoline (a degradation product of the quinine Perkin was so interested in finding) in tar.

Experiments with coal tar and other organic synthesis projects were a productive area for Hofmann to build a research career on. The structure Hofmann's the lab is [seen as the precusor to the modern industrial chemistry research lab](https://doi.org/10.1021/cr0300946), and was a source of many discoveries, such as the [isolation of benzene (then benzole)](https://doi.org/10.1039/QJ8490100244) by his British student Charles Mansfield. Additionally, Hofmann was the first to build physical ball-and-stick "glyptic formulae" models to display and object representing the atomic connections inside molecules, and his choice of black for carbon, white for hydrogen, and red for oxygen remain in wide use today.

{:.figcaption}

Despite Hofmann's lab being in Imperial College London (he moved to the University of Berline in 1865), and Perkin being the first to commercialise aniline dye's in Britian, this nascent dye and chemical industry was to come to be dominated by Germany, largely due to economic and technological factors. A key factor was the industrial production of synthetic liquid and gaseous fuels from coal tar , that was [invented in Germany in 1920s](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80469-1). As Germany had vast coal deposits and almos no natural petroleum reserves, this Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of fuel from coal tar was crucial for the energy, transport and military viability of German. From industrial manipulation of coal tar deposits and creation of industrial chemical plants, the feedstocks and techniques for dye creation became plentiful. 

The economic advantage industrial scale organic syntehsis far outgrew the impact of dyestuffs. A letter to *Nature* in 1934 [puts it plainly](https://doi.org/10.1038/133576a0): 
>"WHILST the original discovery of a coal-tar dye was made by an Englishman... The consequent decline of the British coal-tar colour industry was already well marked in 1875, and in 1886 had proceeded so far that 90 per cent of the dyes then used in Britain were of foreign manufacture... It is not an overstatement to say that the development of this highly scientific and extremely profitable industry in Germany instead of in Great Britain had enormous, if not decisive, political and economic effects both before and during the War." 

Enclosed with this submission to *Nature* is an additional letter where John Brunner (co-founder of a chemical firm that would later merge to become Imperial Chemical Industries) opines in 1915 that had he and his chemist brother had money in their 'teens' their fascination with aniline dyed silk skeins would have driven them to keep the coal tar chemical industry in Britian.  

### Coal tarred and feathered 🪨
The importance of the profits from dyes in the founding of chemical companies can be seen in the names of industrial giants which are still around today, for example: BASF - *Badische Anilin und Sodafabrik* (Baden **Aniline** and Sodium Carbonate Factory). BASF remains the largest produce of chemicals in the world, a multinational across 80+ countries with an annual revenue around €70 billion. It's history has touched on many chemical process famous in school curricula: BASF's main trade was in dyestuffs until the 1900s;  the rise of this company was meteoric after [Haber and Bosch invented their method]({% post_url 2023-06-14-nitrogen-fixation %}) to turn nitrogen from the air into fertiliser; the sodafabrik part of BASF is infamous of New South Wales highschool students who had to memorise the conditions of the Solvay process as part of their Industrial Chemistry module; and BASF invented polystyrene in the 1930s.  

Under Nazi rule before and during WWII, BASF would be joined under the chemical conglomerate I.G. Farben (loosely, "The Colour Syndicate") of notorious and horrific historical fame. This conglomerate was founded by Carl Bosch through merging BASF with Hoechst (now merged under Sanofi), Bayer (widely known for aspirin), and a few other smaller chemical companies. While IG Farben was seized by Allied forces, its forced labour abolished, and the conglomerate split up into its constinuent components, several of these companies such as BASF were refounded and allowed to rehire many of the same directorial staff who had served at the behest of depraved, horrific warmongers. These challenges to societal and base human conscience, the reshaping of entire industries, the discovery of new medical compounds (antifungals and antibiotics), and spectral unfurling of dyes for fabrics of all colours, resulted from an insight into the puzzling carbon skeleton structure of these newly synthesisable "aromatic" substances.   

### Benzene: The daydream snake 🐍♻️♾️ 
Benzene is a molecule, whose empirical formula defied the trends determined from other hydrocarbons. It took 40 years from the experimental isolation of benzene to solve its chemical structure. 

%% Talk about how hexagons are taught to introductory organic chemistry courses, with the story of the dream snake told the world over


Did Kekule truly have a sudden prophetic dream solution? It's impossible to verify someone's recount of their internal thinking, and some have speculated on this story being [embellished in order establish a legacy](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ed052p709) due to being retold only many years later at the the "Benzolfest" in Kekule's honours. It's unlikely bolt from the blue, as more dramatic mythology for chemistry students might go, since organic structure was Kekule's waking profession, but [contemporary letters](https://www.nature.com/articles/465036a) has been used to argue that Kekulé's daydream account and primarcy claims of a carbon ring wrapping on on itself weren't refuted in his time. The snake grabbing it's own tale is of course widely known symbolism. Interestingly, it has alchemical connections it it's origins...

{:.figcaption}

The dreamsnake again rears its head (and heads its rear) in the novel *Gravity's Rainbow*. The WWII IF Farben chemical colour cartel functions as a constant ominous industrial spectre stalking the book, tragically mirroring how scientifically and commercially pioneering chemical companies were wrested into the control of war leaders to commit inhuman acts; the 'Them' of the military-industrial complex which haunts the book's entire narrative. The image of Kekulé's serpentine solution to benzene's structure repurposed as a metaphor of the economic boon and destructive cycle the war economy of WWII brings:

> “Kekulé dreams the Great Serpent holding its own tail in its mouth, the dreaming Serpent which surrounds the World. But the meanness, the cynicism with which this dream is to be used. The Serpent that announces, “The World is a closed thing, cyclical, resonant, eternally-returning,” is to be delivered into a system whose only aim is to violate the Cycle. Taking and not giving back, demanding that “productivity” and “earnings” keep on increasing with time, the System removing from the rest of the World these vast quantities of energy to keep its own tiny desperate fraction showing a profit: and not only most of humanity—most of the World, animal, vegetable, and mineral, is laid waste in the process... No return, no salvation, no Cycle—that’s not what They, nor Their brilliant employee Kekulé, have taken the Serpent to mean. No: what the Serpent means is—how’s this—that the six carbon atoms of benzene are in fact curled around into a closed ring, just like that snake with its tail in its mouth, GET IT?"

--- *Gravity's Rainbow*, Thomas Pynchon, pg. 412, Penguin 2nd Ed.

The connection to colour and dyestuffs in the novel does not end there; the essay [*"Coloring Gravity's Rainbow"*](https://doi.org/10.16995/pn.374) applies a critical lens to the chromatic and chemical connections and how they shift throughout the book. The protagonist's very name ---Tryone--- has be interpreted to be linked with Tyrian purple, his depiction with colour scales that alter as the narrative shifts, the recurring theme of subjection to the totalisating nature of nomenclature and technology linked to the naming schemes of the colour industry. 

The connection between the dye industry and the ability to wage were was well noted in the period between the world wars, a American industrial pamphlet from the 1920s declares: 

"Who makes dyes today can tomorrow make high-explosives"

### How ring stability enables destruction and cures 💥💊

The lack of reactivity of benzene was puzzling to chemists ever since it was first insolated. The high empirical C/H ratio implies it is a unsaturated compound, which are normally receptive to addition reactions. It is now clear that the carbon rings in benzenoids are unreactive because their electronic arrangements are already stable, however that does not mean benzene derived compounds are inheritly inert. Quite the opposite, the core stability of benzenoids has lead to the generation that either have phenomonenal longetivity or massive destructive power depending on what's attached to the ring. These aromatic molecules have become notorious globally in their own right, with entire departments required to mitigate their danger to human life.

### The birth of "resonance" and fictious intermediates ⌬ ↔ ⏣
- Kekulé's daydream, while dozing off on a London bus, of atoms writing around in a snake*like* fashion where one chain of atoms seizes its own tail.

![Kekulé's benzene schematic](/images/kekule_benze_chains.jpg){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

Kekulé's schematic of benzene illustrates a sense of overlap, but doesn't accord with current ways of representing organic molecules. —--["Sur la constitution des substances aromatiques"](https://lib.ugent.be/catalog/rug01:001282677), Kekulé M., *Bulletin mensuel de la Société Chimique de Paris*, pg. 98-111, **1865**.
{:.figcaption} 

- Something about how Kekulé used this sausage representation (literally refered to as *wurst* in his time), as contemporary chemical thought the valency property of an element was due to multiple subparts each capable of forming a connection. This is clearer in [other diagrams](/images/kekule_sausage_formulas.jpg) where the 'atomicity' particles are shown like they're wrapped in a sock to form the overall element. This provided the ability to show multibond connections in elongated multivalent elements, but the horizontal limitations of these "sausage" formulas led Kekulé to some mistaken structural assignments (such as a triangular form of benzene) other organic chemists immediately picked up on based on experimental evidence (e.g. additions to the benzene ring occuring in patterns that are unique to a regular hexagon).
- Something about Kekule's tetravalent carbon ring holding together by oscillating collisions with two neighbouring carbons, equally spaced apart, and one hydrogen. 

- Aromaticity (a terrible misnomer, as with most chemical nomenclature, from a generalisation of the observation that benzene and toluene smell sweet). 
- Add some history of why it was called aromaticity (scientist names). Talk about how aromatic 'sections' of molecules give them some of their most interesting chemical behaviour
- Resonance  --- a terrible misnomer, as with most chemical nomenclature, because molecular nuclei do *not* 'resonate' between two separate resonance structures ([as many of the original theorists well knew, though confusion rose rapidly due partly to sloppy exposition by Pauling in a campaign to expand the conceptual basis of structural chemistry.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4027968)).  [misunderstanding of Kekule claiming "vibrating" he literally meant internal vibrational temporary distortions of a D6h symmetric ring, not oscillating between "resonance contributors" 
- Figure of benzene "resonance contributors" and the true delocalised dashed line ring version 
- The Soviet opposition to resonance. The term mesomerism occasionally making an appearance instead.  
A vocal minority of Soviet scientists [viewed the resonance concept as fictitious mathematical idealisation that was antithetical to dialectal materialism](https://www.jstor.org/stable/227752), so the state adopted a terminological slight of hand to avoid referring to resonance or using 'resonance structures' as a teaching aid.  
- Armit and Robison popularised the term and "[aromatic sextet](https://doi.org/10.1039/CT9252701604)" with many persuasive molecular examples that different greatly from benzene but still maintain delocalised rings of six electrons. Ernesy Crocker, a scientist who never pursued the "Doctor" title, [go there first](https://doi.org/10.1021/ja01429a002) by applying the atomic "octect rule" to all atoms in benzene with Lewis-Langmuir bonding and accounting for the aromatic stability from the remaining six electrons. He places the electrons clearly "outside" the ring due to charge considerations, but that the *"electrons are continually vibrating in the plane of the ring... The net physical effect... serving to bind together all carbon atoms present into virtually a single atom."*
- *Chemical Reviews* provides a good instructional [review paper on this history](https://doi.org/10.1021/cr0300946), including that Kekulé himself never put powered an "oscillating single-and-double bond" model that is often still sloppily introduced to early chemistry students. He was adamant that all 6 carbon atoms share a *fully symmetric* structure, fluxional only in that it was mediated by collisional atomic vibrations, never that "resonance *intermediates*" truly existed as stable equilbirum structures. 

... this segues back in William Perkin knowing enough about aromatic chemistry to search for quinine precusors.  [Actually, Kekule's benzene is in 1865 and Perkin discovers aniline purple in 1856.. so but Kekule after Perkin and leading into the German industrial behemothss

### The electronics of dyes 🎨

![p -> π electron delocalisation](/images/p_to_pi_cloud_aromatic.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto}

Chemical aromaticity arises due to a planar cyclic p-orbital system that can delocalise to form a π-electron system around a closed ring. ---*LibreTexts Chemistry* [*15.9: "What Is the Basis of Hückel’s Rule?"*](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Map%3A_Organic_Chemistry_%28Smith%29/15%3A_Benzene_and_Aromatic_Compounds/15.09%3A_What_Is_the_Basis_of_Huckels_Rule), Tim Soderberg (University of Minnestota, Morris)

Hückel's rule for aromaticity: any cyclic arrangement of $$ 4n+2 $$ carbon atoms, where electrons are "shared" between all atoms in the ring, $$ n=1,2,3... $$

The absorbance wavelength of an asymmetric dye is no redder than the mean wavelength of its symmetric parents and deviates from this by a blue shift which increases as the difference in basicity of the terminal groups.

-  Azulene from azure 'blue' and the -ene suffix of double bonds. 
- [Research in 2023](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c07625) proposes why azulene's light emission is special from the excited state: it has a unique anti-aromatic properties that means it disobeys a long standing principle in photochemistry --- that photon emission is from the lowest electronic state of a give electron spin state. It also displays beautiful examples of (anti)aromatic ring currents.  %This paper has a really good illustration of pi-aromaticity, whether it forms multiple small rigns, or one large ring around the perimeter

-Porphyrins also cause electrons to behave in very interesting ways...

- Just this years researchers made a massive (for the molecular scale) [18-porphyrin ring](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5c09149) that displays [current across 242 electrons running through the entire system](https://phys.org/news/2025-09-member-nanoring-boundaries-global-aromaticity.html).


#### Porphyrins everywhere: green 🍃, yellow 🥚, red 🩸, glowing 🐛
- Use of porphyrin and porphyrin derivatives in other organisms:
	- cholorphyll - [link to the WEHI's gobsmacking animation of the photosynthesis process](https://youtu.be/jlO8NiPbgrk?si=qAVHE1R_WHU4dvS1) that shows the quantum process of closely held chlorophyll pairs converting light into electron flow by splitting the surrounding water into oxygen.
 	- In another instance of photobiology, porphyrins are found in Sierra luminous millipedes (*Motyxia*) where the 'glow-in-the-dark' [appearence of the millipede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motyxia#/media/File:Motyxia_sequoiae_(Loomis_&_Davenport,_1951).jpg) is known to come from a [photoprotein containing a porphyrin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305049184903675?via%3Dihub) but whose structure is unresolved (and maybe should be re-investigated now that previous homology models have been drastically improved upon in the AlphaFold age). 
	- billins e.g. phycobilin (algea) where they are used by non-animal organism for [interesting light harvestin properties.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08811), including making light-harvest 'antennae' stacks of phycobilisomes.
	- the pigment that makes [egg shells brown](https://www.compoundchem.com/2016/03/26/eggs/) (or blue-y green when if broken down to oocyanin)
	- haem (as in haemoglobin) famously striking colour of bright red oxygenated blood, which is broken down within 3-4 months by yyour liver to produce not a purple pigment, but first the disconcerting green and amber pigments of bile, then the [light yellow of urine](https://www.compoundchem.com/2017/01/12/bodily-fluids/). Unless you are unluckly enough to be suffering from [porphyria disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyria) where haem is badly formed and your urine does indeed turn purple.
	- the fur of mammals have also been known to glow under UV [due to accumulation of porphyrin as a disposal mechanism](https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en/museum/media/press/fur-glowing-under-uv-a-common-feature-mammals).
	- geoporphyrins from crude oil and shale, which were are [chemical indicators petroleum presence](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c02002), and one of the [first clues that petrol has biological origin](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2005.09.001)
	- the vitamin B12 [core framework socket where cobalt sits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12#/media/File:Cobalamin_skeletal.svg).


### Retinal, in our eye 👁️ and in microbes 🦠 
 - Bacteriorhodopsin, occurs in the "purple membrane" which is 60 % protein by weight, and perhaps intimately linked with vision itself as the origin origin of molecular basis of light detection since the retinal that has been used to pump protons is also what drives occular vision. The strucutre of bacteriorhodopsin was [solved to decent resolution using cryo-EM](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(05)80271-2) by Richard Henderson and co-workers, who would later go on to win a [Nobel prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2017/popular-information) in part due to that work. 
- The bacteriorhodopsin proton pumping process is illustrated in [this video](https://youtu.be/w241TNxqa6I?si=CXurpxOgOoDX-key) showing how retinal's absorption of a photon triggers an isomeration concurrent with a protein shape change and exited-state proton transfer.  
- Found in all sorts of light harvesting organisms, including the Asgard archaea

Which brings us full circle. Purple gave nature rhodopsin, allowing bacteria to feed off light. Rhodopsin now mediates our dim light vision (most sensitive to blues), while our cones allow us to gaze on purple in all its power and write a post of purple prose about it.
