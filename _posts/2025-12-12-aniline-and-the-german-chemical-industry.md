*In this post I'm aiming to give a broad-brush overview of how near-infinite array of colours we see in textiles today was wrought from some of the most murky carbon substances known. This post will focus on* <span style="color:rebeccapurple">purple</span> (specifically, <span style="color:#8D029B">mauveine</span>). 

*I'd like to more on specific dyes in the future because they have so many fascinating chemical properties. For example,* <span style="color:indigo">indigo</span> *forms from a dimer using the indole group common in biochemistry, placing it within striking distance of tryptophan (amino acid $$W$$) in the biosynthetic pathway.*

Indigo is made from joining two slighly modified indole molecules. Indole is such a common structure in biology that it is used to make typtophan, one of the 20 standard amino acids, which can reveal protein folding properties through fluorescence. ---Synthesis diagram from *Plant Cell Reports*, 35, [pg. 2449–2459](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00299-016-2046-3), **(2016)**.

### Pauvre mauve 🪻

There's an abundance of green in the natural world (likely because plant chlorophyll is [tuned for reliable photosynthesis](https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-are-plants-green-to-reduce-the-noise-in-photosynthesis-20200730/)), but blues and purples stick out because they are so [rare in nature](https://set.adelaide.edu.au/news/list/2019/08/20/why-is-the-colour-blue-so-rare-in-nature). Maybe that's why blue is [humanity's favourite colour](https://au.yougov.com/international/articles/12336-why-blue-worlds-favorite-color-1). The rare examples of natural blue is unsual --- bird and butterfly wings have to restort to optical trickery (metamaterials); blueberries get their name and antioxidant health craze because their skin packed with the crop pigment [anthocynanin](https://en.wikipediea.org/wiki/Anthocyanin); and the blue skin of the poison dart frog is from the very same chemical (pumiliotoxin) that makes it poisonous; and lobsters change spectacularly from blue to red upon boiling due to denaturing [crustacyanin](https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201501609).

![Anthocyanin skeleton](/images/anthocyanidine_320-228.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

Almost all colours in the blue end of the spectrum (among others) are built from the anthocyanidin skeleton shown above. ---*Wikimedia Commons*, [NEUROtiker, 5 August 2008](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Anthocyanidine.svg). 
{:.figcaption}

Similarly, there's an almost complete abscence of natural purple. Purple cabbage and eggplant contain the same anthocyanins as blueberries, similary for violets whose flowers are so striking the colour is named after them but do not make a colourfast dye that will last in fabric. So, when nature was our only source of chemicals, people's desire the harness the spectrum of 'cool' colours came from crushing the leaves of the somewhat drab woad and the perennially popular indigo --- which names both the plant and one of Newton's seven 'ROYGB**I**V' colours. 

The only concentrated, colourfast sources of organic purple come from the seas. *Aplysia* sea slugs [spray purple](https://youtu.be/qmn1bpz00qA?si=ajvqjlsCp7IaI25-) aplysioviolin molecules when threatened, which they have built up from eating red algea; stripping the colourant molecule from the algae's light harvesting proteins and concentrating this aplysioviolin derivative within the seahare's ink glands. A painstaking, but more reliable, way to obtain natural purple is to extract ink glands from the *Murex* sea snail. The 'Tyrian purple' dye harvested from these snail glands was, and is, [outrageously expensive](https://youtu.be/IVXqisH6VeM?si=mRh5GDGBscIPJDDH), fetching around $3000 USD/g in the 21st century. Tyrian purple is in fact a brominated derivative of indigo, synthesised using a bromoperoxidase enzyme unique to *Murex*. Scientists still have not confirmed the active metal within the *Murex*'s bromoperoxidase enzyme (most bromoperoxidases use the rare Vanadium), or which sea snail gene encodes for this purple producing enzyme. 

### Lapis lazuli and other blues of value 🔵

For making dyes, even the colour diversity found within the minerals of the Earth was of little help; the naturally occuring mineral pigments are prone to dull hues, rapid fading, and discolouration into green (*e.g.* azurite). Synthetic mineral blue dyes had to be created in ancient times from copper silicates (mixed with calcium - "Egyptian Blue", or barium - "Han Blue & Purple"), or otherwise just from indigo 'baked into' a mineral substrate, as detailed in a in *Chemical Society Reviews* article on ["The invention of blue and purple pigments in ancient times"](https://doi.org/10.1039/B606268G). Han Purple did not provide a pure purple, but is due to red-copper oxide impurities. Pure, brilliant blue mineral pigment was only provided by eye wateringly expensive lapis lazuli (ultarmarine), mined only around the mountains on the North-Eastern tip of Afghanistan. Ultramarine would cost up to 100x other pigments, but its dazzling effect was valued in relgious iconography across Asia and Europe, and saw notable use in famous paintings (*e.g.* the [blue headscarf](https://heritagesciencejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40494-020-00364-5) in *"Girl with a Pearl Earring"*). Since mineral pigments and synthetics paled in comparison to "true" ultramarine, lapis lazuli was in demand well into the 19th century. The physical origin of the intense blue appearance of ultramarine is chemically interesting: rather than a metal at the centre of the mineral, the colour comes instead from a negatively charged trisulfur radical (S$$_3^{.-}$$).

{:.figcaption}

Now with modern chemistry, blue hues can be made that are so striking that an artist can make a multimillionair dollar name for themselves with [one famous blue dye](https://www.invaluable.com/blog/yves-klein-blue/), and scientific careers and reputations can be built upon chemists' prowess to manufacture the [bluest blue](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/quantum-blue-berkeley_n_5b8db0a4e4b0511db3db33a1). The chemistry the could produce commercially abundant purple dyes was however only cracked in the 19th century. Even now, there is unplumbed depths to these hues, the colour terminology for purple and violet is murky, our [visual perception](https://jakubmarian.com/difference-between-violet-and-purple/) strains near the UV wavelengths, and even the [colour range](https://ericportis.com/posts/2024/okay-color-spaces/) of our computer monitors come up short. 
 

### Porphyrogeniture 👑

Purple has long signified royalty and power, to the point that its use was restricted to high office, not just due to the expense of natural purple dye, but often enforced by social codes and law. Famously, Romans officials would colour their formal attire (togas) with a strip of purple along the border. This style, the *toga praetexta* (from Preator, a magistrate position below Consul) wasn't solely restricted to appointed officials, but likely had a religious origin and was worn by priests and [pre-adolescent children of fortunate birth](https://www.jstor.org/stable/693055). However, a toga fully clad in purple become restricted to Roman consuls and generals performing a Triumph, and later to the Emperor alone, and the unsanctioned wearing of purple was even codified as an offence punishable by death during Nero's reign. 

The association of the Tyrian purple hue with royalty extended beyond clothing, and Byzantine (Eastern Roman) queens would give birth to future rulers in rooms decorated with a deep-purple Imperal Porphyry stone (from Ancient Greek *porphyra* - purple). This birthright to distinction through colour was enforced from cradle to grave, as Emperors were buried in tombs made from porphyry, some [survive today outside the Archealogical Museum in Instanbul](https://www.pallasweb.com/deesis/imperial-porphyry-tombs.html). The purple name echoes throughout history, such as the sisters Zoe and Theodora Porphyrogenita who co-ruled the Byzantine empire after a popular revolt. 

### Born in the purple 🟣 

Ironically, despite the incredibly rarity of steadfast purple in nature, purple was the first in a tidal wave of synthetic industrial dyes, bringing the colour to the masses causing it to become commonplace and unfashionable in quickly after reaching the mass market. The discovery of artifical purple dye (mauvine) was entirely accidentally, but the chemical knowledge to synthesise at massive scale required unravelling some of the fundemental mysteries in organic (carbon-based) chemistry, and clarification about how electrons create molecular structure and govern the interactions of dye molecules with light.

### Muckracking ⚗️
Ahh Perkin was a student of August Wilhelm von Hofmann, who is considered by science historians to by one of the ["fathers of synthetic chemistry"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/anie.199212653) (he Jamcian-born chemist John Blyth were the first to use the term "synthesis" in a publication). Wind the story back to him and the German chemical industry. von Hofmann was xeresponsifor the experiments that isolated alinine from coal tar. 

Wilhem von Hofman's first publication in 1843 was titled [*"Chemische Untersuchung der organischen Basen im
Steinkohlen-Theeroel"*](https://doi.org/10.1002/jlac.18430470106) ("Chemical Investigation of the Organic Bases in Coal-Tar Oil"). Hofmann was to find both aniline (the basis for dyes) and quinoline (a degradation product of the quinine Perkin was so interested in finding) in tar. 

Hofman was the first to make use of "ball-and-stick" models to display and object representing the atomic connections inside molecules, and his choice of black for carbon, white for hydrogen, and red for oxygen remain in wide use today would have driven them to keep the coal tar chemical industry in Britian.

Hofmann's structure of the lab is [seen as the precusor to the modern industrial chemistry research lab](https://doi.org/10.1021/cr0300946), and was a source of many discoveries, such as the [isolation of benzene (then benzole)](https://doi.org/10.1039/QJ8490100244) by his British student Charles Mansfield. 

This can be the coal-tar stuff, making synthetic gas from coal. German chemical dominance


A letter to *Nature* in 1934 [puts it plainly](https://doi.org/10.1038/133576a0): 
>"WHILST the original discovery of a coal-tar dye was made by an Englishman... The consequent decline of the British coal-tar colour industry was already well marked in 1875, and in 1886 had proceeded so far that 90 per cent of the dyes then used in Britain were of foreign manufacture... It is not an overstatement to say that the development of this highly scientific and extremely profitable industry in Germany instead of in Great Britain had enormous, if not decisive, political and economic effects both before and during the War."

under which a fascinating additional letter is enclosed where John Brunner (co-founder of a chemical firm that would later merge to become Imperial Chemical Industries) opines in 1915 that had he and his chemist brother had money in their 'teens' their fascination with aniline dyed silk skeins would have driven them to keep the coal tar chemical industry in Britian.  

The success of a synthetic dyes lead to a [complete collapse of the economic harvesting of natural dyes such as madder root](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43427950). 

- Fischer–Tropsch process for synthetic liquid fuels from coal tar was [invented in Germany in 1920s](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80469-1), and crucial for Germany to fight on in WWII as the country has almost no petrol itself but plentiful coal deposits. Similar processes to convert coal gases to liquid fuels have [fallen in and out of favour as petroleum supply moved through booms and crises](https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/liquid-assets/3004666.article). 

-Something about Perkin, Hofmann and all these chemists were working on "aromatic" (*e.g.* benzoin, *i.e.* incense) compounds without having insight into their puzzling structure.

### Benzene: The daydream snake 🐍♻️♾️ 

Benzene is a molecule. It has a storied history of it's organic structure being tough to figure out, but when it was the concept unlocked whole new fields of synthesis.  

- It took 40 years from the experimental isolation of benzene in a lab to solve its chemical structure. Remeber structural proposals were well before the discovery of the electron, and benzene was a interesting system to work [out it's six-aromatic electon rule](https://doi.org/10.1021/cr0300946).  (Begat six aromatic electrons paper)

- There's disagreement on this in "[Chemistry's visual origins](https://www.nature.com/articles/465036a)"

- Okay, I really need to read ["Image and Reality

{:.figcaption}

Kekulé's serpentine solution of benzene's structure is actually used within the book Gravity's Rainbow as a metaphor the economic boon that destructive cycle of WWII war economy brings:
> “Kekulé dreams the Great Serpent holding its own tail in its mouth, the dreaming Serpent which surrounds the World. But the meanness, the cynicism with which this dream is to be used. The Serpent that announces, “The World is a closed thing, cyclical, resonant, eternally-returning,” is to be delivered into a system whose only aim is to violate the Cycle. Taking and not giving back, demanding that “productivity” and “earnings” keep on increasing with time, the System removing from the rest of the World these vast quantities of energy to keep its own tiny desperate fraction showing a profit: and not only most of humanity—most of the World, animal, vegetable, and mineral, is laid waste in the process... No return, no salvation, no Cycle—that’s not what They, nor Their brilliant employee Kekulé, have taken the Serpent to mean. No: what the Serpent means is—how’s this—that the six carbon atoms of benzene are in fact curled around into a closed ring, just like that snake with its tail in its mouth, GET IT?"

Kekulé's schematic of benzene illustrates a sense of overlap, but doesn't accord with current ways of representing organic molecules. —--["Sur la constitution des substances aromatiques"](https://lib.ugent.be/catalog/rug01:001282677), Kekulé M., *Bulletin mensuel de la Société Chimique de Paris*, pg. 98-111, **1865**.
{:.figcaption} 

- Something about how Kekulé used this sausage representation, as contemporary chemical thought the valency property of an element was due to multiple subparts each capable of forming a connection, allowing elements to combine (described as 'atomicity' in that time.) This provided the ability to show multibond connections in elongated multivalent elements, but the horizontal limitations of these "sausage" formulas led Kekulé to some mistaken structural assignments (such as a triangular form of benzene) other organic chemists immediately picked up on based on experimental evidence (e.g. additions to the benzene ring occuring in patterns that are unique to a regular hexagon).
- Something about Kekule's tetravalent carbon ring holding together by oscillating collisions with two neighbouring carbons, equally spaced apart, and one hydrogen. 

- Aromaticity (a terrible misnomer, as with most chemical nomenclature, from a generalisation of the observation that benzene and toluene smell sweet). 
- Add some history of why it was called aromaticity (scientist names). Talk about how aromatic 'sections' of molecules give them some of their most interesting chemical behaviour
- Resonance  --- a terrible misnomer, as with most chemical nomenclature, because molecular nuclei do *not* 'resonate' between two separate resonance structures ([as many of the original theorists well knew, though confusion rose rapidly due partly to sloppy exposition by Pauling in a campaign to expand the conceptual basis of structural chemistry.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4027968)).

- Figure of benzene "resonance contributors" and the true delocalised dashed line ring version 
- The Soviet opposition to resonance. The term mesomerism occasionally making an appearance instead.  
A vocal minority of Soviet scientists [viewed the resonance concept as fictitious mathematical idealisation that was antithetical to dialectal materialism](https://www.jstor.org/stable/227752), so the state adopted a terminological slight of hand to avoid referring to resonance or using 'resonance structures' as a teaching aid.

... this segues back in William Perkin knowing enough about aromatic chemistry to search for quinine precusors.  [Actually, Kekule's benzene is in 1865 and Perkin discovers aniline purple in 1856.. so but Kekule after Perkin and leading into the German industrial behemothss

### Retinal, in our eye 👁️ and in microbes 🦠 
 - Bacteriorhodopsin, occurs in the "purple membrane" which is 60 % protein by weight, and perhaps intimately linked with vision itself as the origin origin of molecular basis of light detection since the retinal that has been used to pump protons is also what drives occular vision. The strucutre of bacteriorhodopsin was [solved to decent resolution using cryo-EM](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(05)80271-2) by Richard Henderson and co-workers, who would later go on to win a [Nobel prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2017/popular-information) in part due to that work. 
- The bacteriorhodopsin proton pumping process is illustrated in [this video](https://youtu.be/w241TNxqa6I?si=CXurpxOgOoDX-key) showing how retinal's absorption of a photon triggers an isomeration concurrent with a protein shape change and exited-state proton transfer.  
- Found in all sorts of light harvesting organisms, including the Asgard archaea

Which brings us full circle. Purple gave nature rhodopsin, allowing bacteria to feed off light. Rhodopsin now mediates our dim light vision (most sensitive to blues), while our cones allow us to gaze on purple in all its power and write a post of purple prose about it.

Purple is my favourite colour :)

*Deep Purple is shrouded in mystique, while there's something spectrally special about [High Violet](https://4ad.com/releases/922) hinting at energies just beyond human perception.*
