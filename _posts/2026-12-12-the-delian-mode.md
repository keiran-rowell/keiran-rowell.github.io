The Lycian league lasted for hundreds of years as an alliance of prosperous and culturally rich city-states along the Southern Turkish coast. Yet they're barely known in modern times outside niche archaeological circles. Perhaps because they didn't expand, they didn't conquer, they didn't have a Great Empire or a Great Leader. Rich civic life is not enough for the historical record --- the narrative of history is of battles and states begat in blood.

The Delian league was an anti-Persian Empire defensive alliance, with Athens as the powerful centre. (treasury moves from Delos to Athens, is that true?)
Intro about the Delian League. 

Athena was the goddess of wisdom, strategic war, and the protector of the city ("Athena Polias"). 

Defensive alliance betcomes an imperialistic tributary system because the centre is too powerful 

### Forgotten Federations

Federalist papers

'Hamilton' connection

### Empire Building

- America as the isolationist state turning to the 'World's Police' after being drawn into WWII
- Germany and expansion into neigbhouring democracies that were drawing back into themselves as the imperial project collapsed
- The thousand year realm myth
- The centre of the hegemon was no longer safe with modern technological developments. With the V2 you could hit the capital regardless of whether the sun ever set on your holdings. There *is* no buffer

The imposition of fascism is brought with sound and fury. The drone of buzz bombs, the liftoff of rockets, the orders barked over the top of any sense or objections, the shortwave broadcasts to a captive enraptured audience, the enraged soundbites of sole saviour reposted throughout a social media echochamber, the cheering of crowds promised a triumphant future in front of fake monuments, the piercing wails of air sirens. It was the last that Delia Derbyshire heard the most, growing up in Coventry during the Blitz.  

% Delia's inspiration of the air-raid siren into synthesised reptitive sound. Delia won a scholarship to Cambridge University where she studied a mathematics degree, incoporating music studies. Video of [her demonstrating synthesis](https://youtu.be/qsRuhCflRyg?si=6mQbVvDQJmQT6oYZ). [Wendy Carlos as well](https://youtu.be/4SBDH5uhs4Q?si=9LpckiUrRIjcoolQ) on the five basic sound waves: sine, square, sawtooth, triangular, and white noise.

### Sirens Into Songs

Early synthetic pioneers found out to embue true emotions into sine and saw waves: creating some of the most evocatively accurate soundscapes of [depression](https://youtu.be/XQEYdgY2M8U?si=5wj2Vh0FD1uuQi_F), [despair](https://youtu.be/SNpIYln58EE?si=6u7ASIeGBbSwTi7r), and [ennervated overawe](https://youtu.be/1RrsiGmLp_E?si=xacVEqkG7AfNDbxD); but also [serene calm](https://youtu.be/yVLjbGs2s-8?si=W7yoW1QleBG9Uo7K), [arrestingly beautiful desert soundscapes](https://youtu.be/OyUkmxy5VMI?si=Id1Ciwpe_AoCTYXY), [cosmic wonder](https://youtu.be/NChqEEz31eE?si=cH4djqqz1EE5N6Cc), [Sci-Fi noire intrigue](https://youtu.be/RScZrvTebeA?si=z02HqP_EojAKpP3B), and several odd [ditties](https://youtu.be/jetzY-W78gg?si=DdpNwUCSC9A7pM02) of [pure joy](https://youtu.be/3YudPg7cbR4?si=dvKPemx7fzEnNMmv). It was the kind of no roadmap cultural movement where Delia could dictate *"Uhh.. forget about this, it's for interest only"* and then unleash [the first (entirely analogue) driving techno beat](https://youtu.be/vwQIgGQLOQ8?si=tzi0diKqHZR_ZkwS). 

% Read Re-Sisters: The early synth pioneers were often unconventional in social categories. (link out to books, trans, etc)

% The transgressive synth pioneers by just being who they are (trans, a woman, ...) and also use Delia and Wendy Carlos to demonstrate sound waves and the physics. Delia's Cambridge Math's connection. The ABC logo Lissajou fuction. The biopic "The Myths and Legendary Tapes" on Delia that only had festival release and can't be purchased.

With growing use of synths in movie scores, pop music, and the commercial release of digital samplers and sequencers (Aussie Fairlight Computer Musical Instrument released [one of the first in 1979](https://youtu.be/jkiYy0i8FtA?si=FgorFmUbZzTeMgdI) the instrument moved from soundscape to melody. The 80s had arrived. People flocked like seagulls to dance on four-on-the-floor pop tracks, with pitch perfect synthesised songlines and unerring drum machines. Just as quickly the weird and experimental became commercial, some Sheffield lads [started an electronic music project](https://youtu.be/gpGMPiWMjN4?si=f8yz58mszBbr0-_R) (The *Doctor Who* rendition their crowd draw) only hitting the big leagues after [meeting a waitress working at a cocktail bar](https://youtu.be/uPudE8nDog0?si=k5Wa7gwBMVD68GMA). 

Everyone was changing up quicky for music television; [childish insecurities](https://youtu.be/u1ZvPSpLxCg?si=jXPmCNQX49c6x-Aj) were discarded to [rule the world](https://youtu.be/aGCdLKXNF3w?si=sWFe8q2tmgX4MBqQ) (and the charts); Al Jourgensen tried his hand at the [Goth romantic thing](https://youtu.be/1VFqVRepm6U?si=nG0J0gFLQ91B-rtD) before quickly swerving [to headbanging hotrod trash](https://youtu.be/GXCh9OhDiCI?si=7bDuRs66fba4nPco); the quintessential post-punk bank reformed as the [quintessential synthpo band](https://youtu.be/9GMjH1nR0ds?si=Ea6TRW4aNCSVQRKr); and an experimental melancholical new wave duo hit meteoric success by placing their edge [under a 4-4 bouncing synth](https://youtu.be/qeMFqkcPYcg?si=vKn4EJDo59adVnLE). By the mid-80s synth had gone full pop and Madonna told us all to just [get into the groove](https://youtu.be/52iW3lcpK5M?si=hjsNBIz0WBlsz46N). Stock Aitken Watermann dominated this new commerical, turning out the synthpop assembly line that produced over 100 Top 40 hits, becoming one of the most [successful](https://youtu.be/PGNiXGX2nLU?si=mhQ5CWLzkUlW7lKh) [hit](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=tBbZR14ow8ZwgAWl) [factories](https://youtu.be/LaTGrV58wec?si=mYV6MNxWXwI9VqaE) [of](https://youtu.be/aGxJm_Sy2aw?si=0gzPliTXFrflLvnc) [all](https://youtu.be/tto_nmsND_o?si=FzXaU1D8ZqPzCh1C) [time](https://youtu.be/d4-1ASpdT1Y?si=hV6AleNEn-nEqvkm). 

Electronic Dance Music (if that category is even definable) competes with other massive genres under rock and pop for most listens, and is widely popular particularly [in Australia](https://mixmag.net.au/read/stats-reveal-that-australians-listen-to-dance-music-more-than-any-other-country-news) and Europe particularly when [set against the American charts](https://youtu.be/7oQFns0WQTo?si=s9CKJjUeaqaZn2Yu). The early affective experiments of the synthesized sounds have been replaced withi dance tracks,free of arresting content and structured around repition for pure hedonism. Anthems have also escaped their nationalistic or community, with loss of designed civic purpose, but also with freedom from offical narrative and record. You can just be, dance, exist, have fun, got do the festival; you don't need to *serve a state purpose or national cause*.

Shutdown of the BBC Radiophonic Workshops under Blair adiminstration due to economic self-sustainability

An inevitable foreclosure, if you follow government fiscial policy where the BBC licence fee is [not public money but taxpayer's money](https://youtu.be/4luBQ8b1j28) and a philopshy that really, [there is no such thing as a society](https://youtu.be/WhJvOKJCYP4?si=7YmWcwBZPSolZ7Hn). Though, one wonders how to continue running [children's programming that discusses the realpolitik](https://youtu.be/_G4dHRN2Dug) of keeping 'true' administrative continuity after the Vietnamese army deposed the *horrific*, brutal, atrocity ridden Communist Party of Kampuchea (Cambodia). 

% Myth's and Legendary Tapes can't be purchased

### There is No Alternative

Funded by a mandatory flat fee (not a market)
Expected to operate like a business (market logic)
But can't actually compete commercially (public service mandate)
Result: experimental/civic programming gets cut, chase ratings instead

The licence fee is literally a collective funding mechanism for civic culture, and they still killed the Radiophonic Workshop for not being profitable enough.


There felt like a dearth of grassroots protest songs during the Second Gulf War. There are no synths on American Idiot, only American hard rock and [heavy use of a pitch correction](https://youtu.be/r00ikilDxW4?si=84gWBNzAgYLY6Wvh) technology [originating the oil industry](https://www.businessinsider.com/auto-tune-developed-by-oil-engineer-2014-7). Similar silence on the U.S. radio charts to the ancillary Middle Eastern wars, though Brian Williams dropped a Leonard Cohen reference in the guiding [beauty of their weapons](https://youtu.be/DrADbquuMb4?si=0RndBZy2hpTSTtFo) in the missiles used against the Assad regime in Syria.

The War on Terror was remote, dispersed, and silent. No air raid sirens provided warning and there was no shelter to take. Instead, a colour scale was used to assess the current terror threat level. Throughout the entire decade the Homeland Security Advisory System threat advisory scale was created it sat in the warm colours; never dropping to 'general risk' (*blue*) or 'low risk' (*green*), it hit *red* ('severe risk') once during actionable insights to UK<->US flight threats, raised to *orange* ('high risk') five times outside of NYC in 2003, but otherwise sat at a constantly ominous *yellow* ('elevated risk') until replaced by a new system in 2011. In fact, it was recommend to remove the low risk tiers altogether, setting the alter on constantly 'gaurded' without reworking the classification criteria. Luckily, civil servants pushed back on [raising the 'gaurded' threat level on the eve of an election](https://web.archive.org/web/20130419031645/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h1W_dkUJZmLCnpf-AJQwNa0N-ptg) due to opportunistic political ramifications. 

### Noise as a Resistance

### Digital Palimpsests

Ain't it funny how Delia's [meat-and-veggies synth experiments](https://youtu.be/jpdiMcEeTJA?si=gtoC47FIZ5K6xdaa) peek through [2016's most lauded experimental hip-hop album](https://youtu.be/LVyGxlgeAjc?si=CC0S1o0nTOJHlIu2). Such sonic overlaying is no accident, it's the very origins of hip-hop's Disc Jockey culture, and continued source of fun in crate digging at a record fair. 

The reveberations of early synth warbles are reproduced into the 90s, with the [slightly surreal start-up sound](https://youtu.be/8jjT4AjTUMA?si=IyUeTVKZ7Or9moO9) in one of the [biggest corporate computing launches in tech history](https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/w3ct5yfs). Just in time to [connect everyone to the information super highway](https://web.archive.org/web/20120824202929/http://pewinternet.org/Static-Pages/Trend-Data-%28Adults%29/Internet-Adoption.aspx) as "carpet bombing" campaign of free CDs (nearing 1/2 manufactured worldwide) brought [America Online](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object/nmah_1395721).

### Federation Returns


### The Owl of Minverva 🦉 

Wisdom takes flight only at dusk, often when it's too late.

Why do things continue to collapse into imperial tributary systems until there's a technological or social systematic shock?
Do lost futures only become visible when an era has already past, or because they only become visible in the murky twilight?

Technology shock permeates quickly, but has financial incentives to be harnessed by status quo power structures. Just because distributed information systems are easier to implement than ever doesn't mean we're guaranteed a future free from tribute to a few monoliths. When power projection moved slowly the world made gods of the rulers of fiefdoms. Even now those structures are deliberate and social; a new type of economic elect in an era where information, goods exchange, and co-ordination systems can span the world in an instant.

Let's hope social coordination and civic productivity can free up our future, one not driven to mass unrest or conflict as its system shock mechanism.

This will be a break in style from the other content. It's more like my own mini 33 1/3rd. Myown 11 1/10th?

I was going to open with the forgotten Lycians despite their logentivitiy the "Why has history forgotten a democratic league that lasted longer than all modern city-states and most empires. Is it because history is written as an account of "who conquered who" like the birthing branches of a family tree?"

The the midpoint is the 1000 year Reich/Delia Growing up to air-raid sirens in the biltz.

The palimpsest is the internet centralising to platforms web 1.0 -> web 2.0 -> fake federation of blockchain/crypto and real federated media alteratives. And federation computing being a way forward for scientific computing

-- Conquest -> capital -> empire   it's all about saying that our interconnection, trade, and interdependence *must* be mediated by a monopoly of force centre isn't it?

- The Lycian League
  - Only Hellenestic state to resist the Lydians (led by Croesus, a king so rich his wealth could only be explained by Midas's golden touch creating golden river during washing)
  - Very last territory in Anatolia to be incorporated into the Roman Empire
  - The Delian League under Athenian (the rebellious league was crushed an Lycia had to return fealty to the Persians)
  - 4thC, throw off th eyoke. Perikles organises the provinces revolt against the Satraps
  - Conquered by Alexander the Great
- Amazing art and coinage. Prefected nearby invetions. Cliff tombs and coffins. Own language. 
- Federated democracies (circle back at end with federated computing?)
  - https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230906-the-ancient-civilisation-that-inspired-us-democracy
  - https://www.barnabyrogerson.com/articles-talks/lycia
- Athenian Ideals
- Ze owl
- Athenian tributary and Imperialism
- An anti-Imperial protection league because an Athenian client state -- knlowledge but also war
- 4 *hundred* years, outlasted any modern democratic nation state.
- Stable federation that didn't become a great power through conquest. A lost future that faded away due to expansionist neighbours. History written in terms of wars (get that quote about boys being raised up in a history of war to think it's normal)
- Longer lasting than modern nation states, and stabler considerin the global calamitoius conflicts that engulfed them in the first half of the 20th Century
- OMG the Federalist Papers mentions the Lycian League and contrasts ancient confedarcies vs American Federation
 - In Federalist Papers [9](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed09.asp), [16](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed16.asp), [45](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed45.asp) and held as an example the United States of America being a confederation of states that would not fall to tyranny.
 - Wow the 'Hamilton' connection and the U.S. now electing a demagogue and sliding into tyranny
- America as the isolationist state turning to the 'World's Police' after being drawn into WWII
- Germany and expansion into neigbhouring democracies that were drawing back into themselves as the imperial project collapsed
- The thousand year realm myth
- The centre of the hegemon was no longer safe with modern technological developments. With the V2 you could hit the capital regardless of whether the sun ever set on your holdings. There *is* no buffer
- The Blitz
- Delia Derbyshire
- Maths and physics at Cambridge to make *sounds* not plot the trajectories of bombs
- The Lissajous polynomials, oscilloscopes, sounds, and the ABC logo (rage?).
- Ruby Payne-Scott
- Air-raid sirens, literally growing up in the Blitz
- Turning the sound of fascism into the post-war reconstruction civic society
- Now it feels quaint because the civic project was lost with Thatcherism, neolibrealism and New Labour
- Hauntology, lost futures
- Thatcher "There is no alternative"
- Hegemonic instutional self-preservation evaluative structures - "Subject to the Ladder"
- Radiophonic funding killed
  - It was defunded because it was given 5 years to *break even*
	- Under Blair! New Labour! Neoliberal economics
- Weave in my aunt recovering a lost piece of Dalek footage that was discarded by the BBC due to funding cuts but with still in the colonial outputs of the ABC archives
  - Delia Derbyshire composing the Dr Who theme in a experimental and economically oddball funding of the public broadcaster, meant to make educational and backing sounds and ended up experimental
  - The colonial outposts preserved what the imperial centre discarded.
  - The funding cuts due to neocon government economics.
- Also people thought synthesised music could be psychological dangerous, weren't sure, legally limited exposure
  - literal fear of alternative frequencie
- It became DANCE MUSIC. Free of content and structured around repition for pure hedonism. (link to Delia's [offhand prototehcno track](https://youtu.be/vwQIgGQLOQ8?si=Yf1WghFeNgDIemjQ), first techno beat)
  - I think my take on Dance Music is there's a loss of civic purpose, but also a freedom from narrative and official record. You can just be, dance, exist, have fun, you don't need to *serve a state purpose or national cause*
- The early synths pioneer were often unconventional in social categories
- "The Myths and Legendary Tapes" also basically lost in the digital age when distribution is easy
- Murals and a plamipsest of public civic aspiration
- Lost futures: "It's easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism"
- The end of history (sike)
- The goddamn "apocalypse rave at the end of the world" BBC news audio sting bit
- Delia Debyshire day
- Web 1.0 => 2.0 => 3.0 (which is going great, lol) as the lost futures and fading palimpsest of our digital inscriptions
- Federated Computing in social media, but also in scientific research
- Mention Flux, and avant-garde new computing scheduler, has built in multi-*site* scheduling mechanisms
