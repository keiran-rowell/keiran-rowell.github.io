### Consider coal and steel
{: .coal-tar}

> "The interface between coal and steel is **coal-tar**. Imagine coal,
down in the earth, dead black, no light, the very substance of
death. Death ancient, prehistoric, species we will never see
again. Growing older, blacker, deeper, in layers of perpetual
night. Above ground, the steel rolls out fiery, bright. But to
make steel, the coal tars, darker and heavier, must be taken
from the original coal. Earth’s excrement, purged out for the
ennoblement of shining steel. Passed over.
We thought of this as an industrial process. It was more. We
passed over the coal-tars. **A thousand different molecules
waited in the preterite dung**. <span class="page-ref">166</span>
{: .coal-tar}


**Slothrop** <span class="etym etym-coal-tar">(German) Schlot = smokestack, Tropf = drip (also fool, like calling someone a 'drip' in English) **[the preterite]**</span>.... 

> "You think you’d rather hear about what you call 'life': the growing, organic Kartell. But it’s only another illusion. A very clever robot. The more dynamic it seems to you, the more deep and dead, in reality, it grows. Look at the **smokestacks**, how they proliferate, fanning the wastes of original waste over greater and greater masses of city. Structurally, they are strongest in compression. **A smokestack can survive any explosion** -- even the shock wave from one of the new cosmic bombs" <span class="page-ref">167</span>

[Slothrop repeatedly descends into the preterite muck, infamously the toilet of human waste but others]

[ As is made clear in passages coal-tar is just dead life + Gravity + time. Synthetic organic chemistry unlocked the rainbow of artificial colours from the pressure of Gravity]

> The new coinages seem to be made unconsciously. Is there <span class="etym etym-coaltar">a single root, deeper than anyone has
probed, from which Slothrop’s Blackwords</span> only appear to flower separately?
> <br> Or has he by the way of language caught the German mania for name-giving, dividing the Creation finer and finer, analyzing, setting namer more hopelessly apart from named, even to bringing in the mathematics of combination, tacking together established nouns to get new ones, the insanely, endlessly diddling play of a **chemist whose molecules are words** <span class="page-ref">448</span>

System, an announcement of Plasticity’s central canon: that
**chemists were no longer to be at the mercy of Nature**. They
could decide now what properties they wanted a molecule to
have, and then go ahead and build it. At du Pont, the next step
after nylon was to introduce aromatic rings into the
polyamide chain. Pretty soon a whole family of “aromatic
polymers” had arisen: <span class="page-ref">249</span>

[Even the diving into the toilet and the *ahem* scene that got it denied a Pultizer prize makes sense in this framework.

looking among the molecules of the time for the hidden
shapes he knew were there...
But he was stumped when he got to benzene. He knew there were six
carbon atoms with a hydrogen attached to each one—but he
could not see the shape. Not until the dream: until he was
made to see it, so that others might be seduced by its physical
beauty, and begin to think of it as a blueprint, a basis for new
compounds, new arrangements, so that **there would be a field
of aromatic chemistry to ally itself with secular power**, and
find new methods of synthesis, so there would be a German
dye industry to become the IG.... <span class="page-ref">412</span>

intelligence, through subsidiaries and licensees like

status that was never to be free from ambiguities. He’d heard

### Kekulé dreams the Great Serpent 
{: .benzene}

> holding its own tail in its mouth, the dreaming Serpent which surrounds the World. But
the meanness, the cynicism with which this dream is to be
used. The Serpent that announces, **“The World is a closed
thing, cyclical, resonant, eternally-returning,”** is to be
delivered into <span class="etym-mauvine">a system whose only aim is to violate the
Cycle</span>. Taking and not giving back, demanding that
“productivity” and “earnings” keep on increasing with time,
the System removing from the rest of the World these vast
quantities of energy to keep its own tiny desperate fraction
showing a profit: and not only most of humanity---<span class="etym-life">most of the
World, animal, vegetable and mineral, is laid waste in the
process.</span> The System may or may not understand that it’s only
buying time. And that time is an artificial resource to begin
with, of no value to anyone or anything but the System, which
sooner or later must crash to its death, when its addiction to
energy has become more than the rest of the World can
supply, dragging with it <span class="etym-coal-tar">innocent souls</span> all <span class="etym-life">along the chain of
life</span>... <span class="page-ref">412</span>

Alive, it was a threat: it was Titans, was an overpeaking of
life so clangorous and mad, such a **green** corona about Earth’s
