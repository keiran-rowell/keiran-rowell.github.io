It's just smoke. Go on, you know I can't say no*

## Make this a 10 min mark one, don't cover *everything* 



-> Through line "From Hell, life". Geothermal life. Silician Mafia. Cystines keeping proteins together. Sulfur atmospheric conditions taking it away. Crop failure from sulfate clouds, though H2SO4 needed in fertiliser.  

A story of commodity value inversion. What caused wars is now sold to be *taken away*. If the petroleum industry shrinks it might invert again

Rubber Vulcanisation

London "Great Smog of 1952" Photochemical Smog
The 1816 "Year Without Summer" from eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia. Crop failures and food shortgages half way across the world. Sulfate aerosol levels.

Byproduct of the petroleoum refining process.

I also think Sulfur is actually sold for negative value -- so much excess if produced that industrial manufactures pay people to take sulfur

Sulfur containing ship fuel. Acts as a global *coolant* but SOx is so toxic in the atmosphere it needs to be banned
The 2020 shipping fuel regulations by the International Martime Organisation caused a brief period of measurable ocean warming as sulfur aerosols dropped.

Sulfur S8 "crowns"?

#### Open on the geothermal vent and sulfur eating life. Heat + energy + sulfur can be metabolism [image of hydrothermal vent]. BILLIONS OF YEARS OLDER THAN PHOTOSYNTHESIS *a couple of sentences setting up the smash cut to modern day humans surrounded by blue fire*
#### Open again on the blue fire of Indonesian suflur mines. (Humans not microbes) [image of blue fire]
4 billion years later, well above the sulfur-eating sea creatures that still cluster around deep-sea vents, Idonesian miners descend into volcano Ijen to start their work. 
#### Move on to the Carusi and the Silician Sulfur mines. (Human societal exploitation) [painting of carusi]
"This hell is not new. Mining brimstone fueled the growth of one of humanity's most notorious organisations --- the Silician Mafia"
#### Gunpowder and Greek Fire. (Human destruction in warfare) [ancient illustration of Greek Fire]
#### Industrial demand (Vulcanisation) then the great economic inversion (S as petroleum byproduct people *pay* to get taken away). [image of modern day S yellow waste mounts] Even if H2SO4 is one of the most produced industrial chemicals and needed for fertiliser. 
#### Natural disasters take away biological life London Smog, Year Without Summer [image of London Smog]
#### Biochemistry -- now reveal Fe-S clusters as the fundamental primeval electron harvest unit. They were the origin but they're *still* essential and unchanged. Proteins stabled together with disulfide bridges in Cysteine. [Protein structure illustration]

##### Limit to the above topics and  make it tight and cinematic

> "I am not prepared just now to say to what extent I believe in a physical hell in the next world, but a sulfur mine in Sicily is about the nearest thing to hell that I expect to see in this life."

["When necessary to guarantee the supply of cheap sulfur against price and supply regulation, the British mobilized their Royal Navy. It is argued that the Sicilian frontier should be incorporated into the history of the Industrial Revolution."](https://doi.org/10.1086/705370)

>  Automatic fire is composed of equal parts of native sulfur, rock salt, incense, thunderbolt stone, or pyrites, ground in a black mortar in the midday sun, and mixed with equal parts of the resin of the black sycamore and liquid asphalt of Zakynthos to a greasy paste. 

--- *Kestoi* [Fragment D25, translated by , Sextus Julius Africanusm, c. 220 CE 


   fireships (inspired by, though not using,  "Greek fire") were instrumental in defeating the Ottoman Empire in the Greeek war of Independence
