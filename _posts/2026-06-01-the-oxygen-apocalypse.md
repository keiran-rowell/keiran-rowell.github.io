### Diradical by Nature

We are protected at every moment by a quantum mechanical safety catch. The most dangerous element of our atmosphere normally can't react with us. It is physically <span class="germania-text">verboten</span>. Oxygen doesn't immediately burn our organic matter to a crisp because our molecules are a different *spin state* to O<sub>2</sub>. 

An insuperable barrier of electronic symmetry is our shield.

The molecular oxygen in the air is a diradical --- it is not stably bound; it  has two unpaired electrons.
... science stuff

Singlet oxygen is its triplet twin let loose. [Be afraid](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dYH7xxYLHvs)

### The plants began to breathe

Oxygen production as an *environmental disaster* that killed most other life.
"The Great Englufing"

### ...and the microbes fled

Aneorobic organisms had to hide

GIANT DRAGONFLIES

### ...and the oceans bled

Oxygen rusted the oceans. It was freen from free iron radical before

### ...and the Earth froze

Oxygen triggering the ice age from the consumed greenhouse blanket

### ...and the sea boiled

The oxygen evolving complex -- split water like its nothing, just from light
Oxidation states because fluoridation states isn't as common. Electron stealers

Birnessite is apparently the mineral closest related

### ...and life rose up

Respiration yields way more energy, higher order life forms could be supported compared to fermenting microbes


### ...and aged away.

Oxygenated free radicals and cell aging. Reactive oxygen species. The *opposite* of rejuvenation
