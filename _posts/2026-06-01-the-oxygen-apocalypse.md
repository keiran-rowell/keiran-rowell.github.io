### Diradical by Nature


We are protected at every moment by a quantum mechanical safety catch. The most dangerous element of our atmosphere normally can't react with us. It is physically <span class="germania-text">verboten</span>. Oxygen doesn't immediately burn our organic matter to a crisp because our molecules are a different *spin state* to O<sub>2</sub>. 

An insuperable barrier of electronic symmetry is our shield.

>
> **The anatomy of a forbidden reaction** --- The two $$\pi^{*}$$ *anti*-bonding orbitals of O<sub>2</sub>. As the frontier orbitals, these determine the reactivity of oxygen. Two electrons of the **same** spin can't occupy the same orbital, so nature has three choices. The same-spin ---triplet state--- option ($$^3\Sigma_g^-$$) which makes up 20% of our atmosphere has its  reactivity "locked", with a net spin density constrained by spin-interaction rules between molecules. For the opposite-spin pairs ---singlet state--- options ($$^1\Delta_g$$ & $$^1\Sigma_g^+$$), both are highly reactive but the rarity of the latter attests to the quantum energy penalty to accessing higher spin states.

The molecular oxygen in the air is a diradical ---  it  has two unpaired electrons. That makes it a molecule in a 'triplet' state. In almost all molecules on earth, they live in a 'singlet' state where all electrons are paired off.

Singlet oxygen is its triplet twin let loose. [Be afraid](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dYH7xxYLHvs)

Rather than the clock resting in 'ground-state', where all manganese metals hold their stable electron count, electrons spontaneously transfer to tyrosine residues placed nearby. The oxygen evolving complex is capable of self-arming in the complete dark: a powerful cluster of manganese ions that have already been destabilised from their +II resting state by donating electrons to the cluster oxygens and surrounding protein.

The cyanobacteria had broken nature's rule of closed-shell ground states, pushing through forbidden symmetry regimes with electromagnetic clockwork. From captured spiralling lightwaves the flow of energy was controlled and constrained; [spin polarisers]() from asymmetric units ensured departing electrons could take the substance the world was drowning in ---singlet water-- and pump out triplet oxygen gas. The cyanos held a quantum lockpick and could now consume the previously verboten.

[Ferromanganese nodules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese_nodule). [We have only recently learned how to engineer artificial mimics](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.929532).

As a bubbling rock, birnessite wasn't threat to survival.
