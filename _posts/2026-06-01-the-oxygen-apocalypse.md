### Diradical by Nature


We are protected at every moment by a quantum mechanical safety catch. The most dangerous element of our atmosphere normally can't react with us. It is physically <span class="germania-text">verboten</span>. Oxygen doesn't immediately burn our organic matter to a crisp because our molecules are a different *spin state* to O<sub>2</sub>. 

An insuperable barrier of electronic symmetry is our shield.

> **The anatomy of a forbidden reaction** --- The two $$\pi^{*}$$ *anti*-bonding orbitals of O<sub>2</sub>. As the frontier orbitals, these determine the reactivity of oxygen. Two electrons of the **same** spin can't occupy the same orbital, so nature has three choices. The same-spin ---triplet state--- option ($$^3\Sigma_g^-$$) which makes up 20% of our atmosphere has its  reactivity "locked", with net spin density constrained by spin-interaction rules between molecules. For the opposite-spin pairs ---singlet state--- options ($$^1\Delta_g$$ & $$^1\Sigma_g^+$$), both are highly reactive but the rarity of the latter attests to the quantum energy penalty to accessing higher spin states.

The molecular oxygen in the air is a diradical ---  it  has two unpaired electrons. That makes it a molecule in a 'triplet' state. In almost all molecules on earth, they live in a 'singlet' state where all electrons are paired off.

Singlet oxygen is its triplet twin let loose. [Be afraid](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dYH7xxYLHvs)

### They captured the sun...

### ...and began to breathe

Oxygen production as an *environmental disaster* that killed most other life.
"The Great Englufing"

The Purple Earth hypothesis
The purple ancients (the archaea)

### ...and the sea boiled

The oxygen evolving complex -- split water like its nothing, just from light
Oxidation states because fluoridation states isn't as common. Electron stealers.

These green bacteria had developed spin-forbidden alien technology. The [Oxygen Evolving Complex](https://doi-org.wwwproxy1.library.unsw.edu.au/10.1126/science.1093087) would radically terraform the Earth. The 'S-state' clock in the Manganese core is a [highly calibrated spin aligner](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0681-2). 

[ S-state clock diagram ]

The cyanobacteria had broken nature's rule of closed-shell ground states, pushing through forbidden symmetry regimes with electromagnetic clockwork. From captured spiralling lightwaves the flow of energy was controlled and constrained; [spin polarisers]() from asymmetric units ensured departing electrons could take the substance the world was drowning in ---singlet water-- and pump out triplet oxygen gas. The cyanos held a quantum lockpick and could now consume the previously verboten. 

[ Diagram of OEC core and birnessite ]

A distorted cube of manganese and oxygen, with jagged edges of calcium, drove this electronic cycle. [The for this spin diode was abundant, as free manganese in seawater and mixed in iron nodules on the ocean floor](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2007.2223).  [We have only recently learned how to engineer artificial mimics](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.929532). This new engine has a mineral heart. Nature had left birnessite lying around in the mantle -- a cubic manganese oxide that [catalytically produces oxygen from water in the presence of calcium](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b05989). As a bubbling rock, birnessite wasn't threat to survival. But wielded by an exponential growing population, the Oxygen Evolving Complex would extinguish ancients and leave behind a furnace world the could fuel their unrecognisably morphed descendants. 

### ...and the oceans bled

Oxygen rusted the oceans. It was freen from free iron radical before

![Jaspilite banded iron formation](/images/Jaspilite_banded_iron_formation.jpg)

The ferrous layer prevented the oxygen from reaching the atmosphere. Only when it was consumed into iron oxides did oxygen escape into the atmosphere


### ...and their kin choked

Corrosion. 

Treat this like a highly corrosive gas spill in a ocean zoo.
Seeping through cell membranes shredding their DNA so their informative was erased from the genetic pool.
The extinction of other life wherever the gas could reach. What's left are in still pockets of anaerobic resistance.

The purple world being bleaches green.

The death of the purple Earth for chlorophyll filled green photosynthesisers

GIANT DRAGONFLIES


### ...and the Earth froze

Methanogenic bacteria

A incredibly thick greenhouse gas blanket

Converted into CO2, a far less potent greenhouse gas (I think it's a factor of 10x-100x, look it up). This is about CO2 really only has antisymmetric modes to do Raman absorption.

Oxygen triggering the ice age from the consumed greenhouse blanket

The great Glaciation. 200 million years of ice age.


### ...and life rose up

Respiration yields way more energy, higher order life forms could be supported compared to fermenting microbes


### ...and aged away.

Oxygenated free radicals and cell aging. Reactive oxygen species. The *opposite* of rejuvenation
