### <span style="color: #8E7CC3">Diradical by Nature</span>


We are protected at every moment by a quantum mechanical safety catch. The most dangerous element of our atmosphere normally can't react with us. It is physically <span class="germania-text">verboten</span>. Oxygen doesn't immediately burn our organic matter to a crisp because our molecules are a different *spin state* to O<sub>2</sub>. 

An insuperable barrier of electronic symmetry is our shield (*expand the briefing below*).

**Technical Briefing: The Quantum Safety Catch**
![The singlet and triplet configuration of the pi-star antibonding orbital in O2](/images/O2_MO_quantum_lock.png) 

**The anatomy of a forbidden reaction** --- The two $$\pi^{*}$$ *anti*-bonding orbitals of O<sub>2</sub>. As the frontier orbitals, these determine the reactivity of oxygen. Two electrons of the same spin **can't occupy the same orbital**, so nature has three choices. The **same-spin triplet state** option ($$^3\Sigma_g^-$$) which makes up 20% of our atmosphere has its  reactivity "locked", with a net spin density restrained from reacting by spin-interaction rules between molecules. For the **opposite-spin** pairs **singlet state** options ($$^1\Delta_g$$ & $$^1\Sigma_g^+$$), both are highly reactive but the rarity of the latter attests to the quantum energy penalty to accessing higher spin states.

   </div>
</details>

The molecular oxygen in the air is a diradical ---  it  has two unpaired electrons: •O–O•. That makes it a molecule in a 'triplet' state. For almost all other molecules on earth, they live in a 'singlet' state where all electrons are paired off. They can't react with each other because doing so would mean the total angular momentum wouldn't be conserved. This safety catch prevents the atmosphere from incinerating the biosphere.

Singlet oxygen is its triplet twin let loose. [Be afraid](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dYH7xxYLHvs)

### They captured the sun...

Before we had the green world as we know it, lifeforms were chemical scavengers. The seas were full of <span style="color: #8E7CC3">archaea</span> (literally, 'the <span style="color: #8E7CC3">ancients</span>') who had to eke out a diet of whatever chemicals around that hadn't yet fully spent its molecular potential energy. This was the Purple Earth, and was fuelled on the chemical dregs of the crust for a billion years. Until, in the late Archean eon, the first single-cellular shoot of <span style="color:#BBDD66">green</span> appeared. 

A biological cousin had become a stranger --- they hoisted an antenna of chlorophyll towards the sun. The archaea had their own antenna, a simple <span style="color: #8E7CC3">**retinal**</span> light gate --- it used centre of the solar spectrum to power primitive pumps. The <span style="color:#BBDD66">**chlorophyll**</span> antenna of the green bacterial newcomers, in contrast, could harvest the high energy blue and deep red fringes. Suddenly they could capture the array of colour energy coming off the fusion furnace the planet circles. They had developed the technology to generate high-voltage electrons from the sun's rays. The Earth would never be the same again.    

### ...and began to exhale 

These chlorophyll wielding bacteria were alien --- living in ways previously inaccessible. They could make energy from the sun, they were photo-synthesisers. But their industrious photosynthesis leaked onto a globe a new alien molecule: oxygen gas. O<sub>2</sub> had never been an component of the atmosphere before, it was a highly exotic molecule only created in brief flashes when extreme UV radiation smashed apart water or CO<sub>2</sub>. This new gas was to eventually snuff out the ancients.

{:.figcaption}

The <span style="color: #8E7CC3">ancients</span> were [sulfur eaters](link to sulfur post). H<sub>2</sub>S could be readily chowed down as an energy source --- it fell apart within the cell at ordinary temperature, its hydrogens surrendered as easy fuel. But oxygen was harder to crack --- it was locked in a molecular safe of water. H<sub>2</sub>O required electrical impulses from photons and quantum trickery to unpick its bonds.

Enter the <span style="color:#BBDD66">cyanos</span>.

Cyanobacteria with the light energy from their more powerful antenna had staged a metabolic coup. The cyanos departed from their ancient ancestors who fed on the sulfur in H<sub>2</sub>S. For the cyanos, H<sub>2</sub>O---the abundant solvent they were suspended in---became *food*. They began to split the most plentiful fuel source on the planet.

### ...and the sea boiled

These green cyanobacteria had developed spin-forbidden alien technology. The [Oxygen Evolving Complex](https://doi-org.wwwproxy1.library.unsw.edu.au/10.1126/science.1093087) would radically terraform the Earth. At its heart: a distorted cube of manganese and oxygen, with a jagged edge of calcium. This was their 'quantum lockpick' to access the forbidden triplet states. Driven by light power, an 'S-state' clock pumped charges from the manganese core. Once electrons were stripped from the core, it became charged enough to fire---rapidly ripping H<sub>2</sub>O apart into the fuel particles the cyanobacteria needed.

Nestled withing Photosystem II at the end of the photosynthesis machinery is the Oxygen Evolving Complex (**OEC**) --- the 'lockpick' that splits apart water to release the protons and electrons used to power the cell. A photon from sunlight knocks an electron off a set of four chlorophylll antennae (P680). To fill the leftover electron hole, an electron is shuffled from off of the OEC, progressively raising the charge of the manganese (Mn) metals. 

This light driven process pushes the OEC up the singlet electronic state ladder (the "**S-clock**" cycle). Eventually the OEC is pushed to its limits, the fourth singlet state <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BA575C;">S<sub>4</sub></span>, and water is ripped apart, pushing the cluster back to resting charge and reseting the S-clock.

  <div class="textbook" markdown="1" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
The S-clock is not set to zero. It is self-priming---set one tick ahead to the S<sub>1</sub> excited state. Rather than the clock resting in a 'ground-state'---where all manganese metals hold their stable electron count---electrons are transferred out of the cluster to tyrosine residues placed nearby. The oxygen evolving complex is capable of self-priming in the complete dark: a powerful cluster of manganese ions that have already been destabilised from their +II configuration by donating electrons to the cluster oxygens and surrounding protein. 

Lying in wait until morning, when the next bombardment of photons can push the cluster to higher and higher charge states, and pass a redline. Some propose a 'firing pin' manganese ion reaches an outrageous **+V charge** in the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BA575C;">S<sub>4</sub></span> state. [Detailed computational work](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2012.10.006) suggests the water molecules are slowly deprotonated and <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BA575C;">S<sub>4</sub></span> creates an 'armed bullet' of an oxyl radical (O$$^{\bullet-}$$). The <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BA575C;">S<sub>4</sub></span> state is so fleeting [not even kilometer-long X-ray Free-Electron Lasers (XFELs)](https://doi.org/10.59717/j.xinn-life.2024.100068) [can detect it](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0681-2). It triggers a violently reactive reset; ripping **four** electrons from water to replenish the cluster in *femto* (10<sup>–15</sup>) seconds; joining oxo-oxyl groups with a missing spin-aligned electron each to form the triplet •O–O• bond; and exhaling oxygen into the environment. The manganese oxide cluster's magnetic moment acts as a **spin template**, ensuring the cell doesn't incinerate itself with a singlet. This process is tightly coordinated to avoid creation of cell-destroying peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) or superoxide (O$$_{2}^{\bullet-}$$) species.

This new engine has a mineral heart.

As a bubbling rock, birnessite wasn't threat to survival. But wielded by an exponential growing population, the Oxygen Evolving Complex would extinguish ancients and leave behind a furnace world the could fuel their unrecognisably morphed descendants.

{:.figcaption}


The **OEC** cluster is a distorted manganese-oxide cube, with calcium edge. Though artificial mimics have been created, it is still if it [had the OEC had direct mineral origin, and if so, which mineral](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00794)? 

Manganese is the [natural metal for water splitting](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2007.2223) due to its versatile oxidation state and favourable redox energetics. Minerals like birnessite also display oxygen evolution, but a far higher overpotentials and creating reactive oxygen species side products that would shred a biological cell. 

The asymmetric cuboid arrangement helps the OEC function as a **"spin diode"**. The cluster's four metal centers are in communication to [tightly coordinate a series of spin slips](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.21.024024) which guide the generation of forbidden **triplet oxygen**. The sequential spin flips are crucial to this near-alien technology developed by the cyanos; they're what allow the OEC to overcome the---previously unbroken---<span class="germania-text">verboten</span> spin-barrier.  
  
   </div>
</details>

The cyanobacteria had broken nature's rule of closed-shell ground states, pushing through forbidden symmetry regimes with electromagnetic clockwork. From captured spiralling lightwaves the flow of energy was controlled and constrained; the spin polariser of the asymmetrically distorted cluster ensured departing electrons would pass through the spin-state barrier. The cyanos could take the substance the world was drowning in ---singlet water--- and, at ambient temperature, pump out triplet oxygen gas. The cyanos held a quantum lockpick and could now consume the previously verboten. 

### ...and the oceans bled

For two billion years, the S-clock ticked along, but under the dampening of the seas the oxygen never esacped to the atmosphere. The oceans had a natural buffer -- they contained iron. 



Oxygen rusted the oceans. It was freen from free iron radical before
