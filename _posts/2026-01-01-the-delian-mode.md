*Long was the year, will you stay now you're here?*

The Lycian league lasted for hundreds of years ([ca. years]) as an alliance of prosperous and culturally rich city-states along the Southern Anatolian coast. Yet they're barely known in modern times outside niche archaeological circles. Perhaps because they didn't expand, they didn't conquer, they didn't have a Great Empire or a Great Leader. Rich civic life is not enough for the historical record --- the narrative of history is of battles and states begat in blood.

The Lycians left behind some [monumental tombs](/images/lycian_cliff_tomb.jpg) hewn into the cliffs of Türkiye and [griffin-fringed sarcophagi](/images/lycian_griffin_sarcophagus.jpg), but their legacy dissipated except amongst a few scholars.

### Forgotten Federations

The Delian league was an anti-Persian Empire defensive alliance, after repelling the largest invasion force the Aegean had ever seen. It united the smaller Greek city-states ---150--200+ at its peak--- against the dominance of the continental threats. Its symbolic core was in Delos, where the Treasury was kept. The members of the alliance paid into the *phoros* tribute systems which provided funds, ships, manpower for the league. The island of Delos had practical advantages: it was central to the Aegean, far flung from any dominant city states, and symbolic power: it was neutral territory controlled by no-one, and was long-sacred as the birthplace of Apollo and Artemis and so hopefully inviolable.  

This alliance among equals, where the *phoros* was paid according to the population, means, and resources of each island city-state lasted in true form for less than 25 years, shattered by a hollowing out alliance structure. In 454 BCE the accumulated treasury was relocated from Delos straight to Athens --- under the justification of security, while also in reality accomplishing fiscal control. Voluntary contributions into the league were now mandatory, the treasury re-appropriated for the glorification of Athens, and Athens began to dictate the politics of other city-states. States which tried to leave were kept in the league by military force, the *phoros* increased, and the tribute paid to Athens from client city states was [totted up in stone for all to see](https://www.davidgill.co.uk/attica/em_atl_578.jpg). In this way all tributaries flowed back to the Athenian well. The Athenian hegemony began to impose democratic government structures across the region. The centre that brought together the League grew too powerful. Sparta, often steadfast and unafraid to be bellicose, grew weary of growing imperial ambitions from Athens, and in the Peloponnesian War that followed Sparta reversed the power structure using the support of the Persian Empire to crush Athens, waging shameless total war, and bringing an end to the Ancient Greek Golden Era as the Aegean states became Spartan subjects.    


Athena was the goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare. Moreover, as *Athena Polias* ('Athena of the City') she was protector of the *polis* --- civic life, the city-state, democratic institutions. 


The impulse to federate, to balance local autonomy with central authority, echoes down the centuries, even if the voices of the *polis* are silent in our history. A resonance resurfaces during experiments in democracy of the early United States.

### Federalism Returns
Federalist papers

'Hamilton' connection

Hamilton. Creator of the Federal Reserve; *the* global benchmark for Funds interest rates, vendor of US Treasuries, and lender of last resort. Hero of the 2015 Broadway historical hip-hop/classical [runaway success](https://youtu.be/DSCKfXpAGHc?si=79B6xRXz-cZevJ_m). It was wildly popular and audiences were humming about *The Room Where it Happens* just a year before electing a leader whose anti-federalist tendencies and refusal to relinquish power strike close to fears the Founding Fathers had that their American experiment in government would be brought to an end by a democratically elected president who would [proceed to dismantle the checks and balances on the reins of power](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/12/trump-third-term-authoritarianism/684616/).

### Empire Building

- America as the isolationist state turning to the 'World's Police' after being drawn into WWII
- Germany and expansion into neighbouring democracies that were drawing back into themselves as the imperial project collapsed
- The thousand year realm myth
- The centre of the hegemon was no longer safe with modern technological developments. With the V2 you could hit the capital regardless of whether the sun ever set on your holdings. There *is* no buffer

The imposition of fascism is brought with sound and fury. The drone of buzz bombs, the liftoff of rockets, the orders barked over the top of any sense or objections, the shortwave broadcasts to a captive enraptured audience, the enraged soundbites of sole saviour reposted throughout a social media echoc hamber, the cheering of crowds promised a triumphant future in front of fake monuments, the piercing wails of air sirens. It was the last that Delia Derbyshire heard the most, growing up in Coventry during the Blitz.  

### Resistance as a Noise

Delia won a scholarship to Girton College at Cambridge University where she studied a mathematics degree, incorporating music studies.

### Sirens Into Songs

Early synthetic pioneers found out to imbue true emotions into sine and saw waves: creating some of the most evocatively accurate soundscapes of [depression](https://youtu.be/XQEYdgY2M8U?si=5wj2Vh0FD1uuQi_F), [despair](https://youtu.be/SNpIYln58EE?si=6u7ASIeGBbSwTi7r), and [enervated overawe](https://youtu.be/1RrsiGmLp_E?si=xacVEqkG7AfNDbxD); but also [serene calm](https://youtu.be/yVLjbGs2s-8?si=W7yoW1QleBG9Uo7K), [arrestingly beautiful desert soundscapes](https://youtu.be/OyUkmxy5VMI?si=Id1Ciwpe_AoCTYXY), [cosmic wonder](https://youtu.be/NChqEEz31eE?si=cH4djqqz1EE5N6Cc), [Sci-Fi noire intrigue](https://youtu.be/RScZrvTebeA?si=z02HqP_EojAKpP3B), and several odd [ditties](https://youtu.be/jetzY-W78gg?si=DdpNwUCSC9A7pM02) of [pure joy](https://youtu.be/3YudPg7cbR4?si=dvKPemx7fzEnNMmv). It was the kind of no roadmap cultural movement where Delia could dictate *"Uhh.. forget about this, it's for interest only"* and then unleash [the first (entirely analogue) driving techno beat](https://youtu.be/vwQIgGQLOQ8?si=tzi0diKqHZR_ZkwS). 

The early synth pioneers were often [unconventional](https://www.allenandunwin.com/browse/book/Cosey-Fanni-Tutti-Re-sisters-9780571362189) in social categories. [Women securing a respected place in traditionalist organisations undergoing a new technology landscape](https://youtu.be/7r-3hlzpV7M?si=3e7fzqAegLWC02bx), openly [queer and trans individuals](https://youtu.be/Z3cab5IcCy8?si=G86RNli9vIi5rU2h), people who were equally comfortable with mathematics and engineering as with classical composition. The BBC Radiophonic Workshop had a policy of staff anonymity ('non-musical' technicians shouldn't compete with the jobs of 'real' composers), which seems to have paradoxically created some space to navigate within the organisation --— you couldn't be dismissed purely on your identity if no one knew who you were. This also ironically meant pioneering work could only be evaluated in hindsight. While Australian composer Ron Grainer wrote the notational sketches of the *Doctor Who* theme, it was Delia's sonic wizardy that took a leftfield implementation and made the iconic sounds her own. It was an uphill battle to get recognition, only half-a-century later was Delia officially recognised in BBC credits. The internet, gladly, is awash with her legacy; remembering what institutions had long forgot.  

With growing use of synths in movie scores, pop music, and the commercial release of digital samplers and sequencers. Aussie company Fairlight released one of the first with the [Computer Musical Instrument (CMI) in 1979](https://youtu.be/jkiYy0i8FtA?si=FgorFmUbZzTeMgdI). The synthetic instrument had moved from soundscape to melody. The 80s had arrived. People flocked like seagulls to dance on four-on-the-floor pop tracks, with pitch perfect synthesised songlines and unerring drum machines. Just as quickly the weird and experimental became commercial, some Sheffield lads [started an electronic music project](https://youtu.be/gpGMPiWMjN4?si=f8yz58mszBbr0-_R) (The *Doctor Who* rendition their crowd draw) only hitting the big leagues after [meeting a waitress working at a cocktail bar](https://youtu.be/uPudE8nDog0?si=k5Wa7gwBMVD68GMA). 

Everyone was changing up quickly for music television; [childish insecurities](https://youtu.be/u1ZvPSpLxCg?si=jXPmCNQX49c6x-Aj) were discarded to [rule the world](https://youtu.be/aGCdLKXNF3w?si=sWFe8q2tmgX4MBqQ) (and the charts); Al Jourgensen tried his hand at the [Goth romantic thing](https://youtu.be/1VFqVRepm6U?si=nG0J0gFLQ91B-rtD) before quickly swerving [to headbanging hotrod trash](https://youtu.be/GXCh9OhDiCI?si=7bDuRs66fba4nPco); the quintessential post-punk bank reformed as the [quintessential synthpo band](https://youtu.be/9GMjH1nR0ds?si=Ea6TRW4aNCSVQRKr); and an experimental melancholic new wave duo hit meteoric success by placing their edge [under a 4-4 bouncing synth](https://youtu.be/qeMFqkcPYcg?si=vKn4EJDo59adVnLE). By the mid-80s synth had gone full pop and Madonna told us all to just [get into the groove](https://youtu.be/52iW3lcpK5M?si=hjsNBIz0WBlsz46N). Stock Aitken Watermann dominated this new commercial, turning out the synthpop assembly line that produced over 100 Top 40 hits, becoming one of the most [successful](https://youtu.be/PGNiXGX2nLU?si=mhQ5CWLzkUlW7lKh) [hit](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=tBbZR14ow8ZwgAWl) [factories](https://youtu.be/LaTGrV58wec?si=mYV6MNxWXwI9VqaE) [of](https://youtu.be/aGxJm_Sy2aw?si=0gzPliTXFrflLvnc) [all](https://youtu.be/tto_nmsND_o?si=FzXaU1D8ZqPzCh1C) [time](https://youtu.be/d4-1ASpdT1Y?si=hV6AleNEn-nEqvkm). 

Electronic Dance Music (if that category is even definable) competes with other massive genres under rock and pop for most listens, and is widely popular particularly [in Australia](https://mixmag.net.au/read/stats-reveal-that-australians-listen-to-dance-music-more-than-any-other-country-news) and Europe particularly when [set against the American charts](https://youtu.be/7oQFns0WQTo?si=s9CKJjUeaqaZn2Yu). The early affective experiments of the synthesized sounds have been replaced with dance tracks,free of arresting content and structured around repetition for pure hedonism. Anthems have also escaped their nationalistic or community, with loss of designed civic purpose, but also with freedom from official narrative and record. You can just be---dance, exist, have fun, got to the festival---*without serving a state purpose or national cause*.

Delia Derbyshire would work late at night in the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, where no one could supervise her obsession. Magnetic tape, meticulously spliced by hand with a razor blade, hung around the rooms --- a hand crafted sample bank. Within the hierarchy of the prestigious institution of the BBC the cover of night gave Delia creative free rein, her sounds could echo the halls and delay effects were instantiated in real physical distance. She held the record for the longest tape loop, trailing off from the read heads it was run in streamers through doors and along the longest corridor in London. The Workshop was filled with oscillators, tone generators, and wobbulators she didn't need to share at night. This was where air-raid sirens became music.
 
The European counterparts to the Radiophonic Workshop (the [*Groupe de Recherches Musicales*](https://120years.net/the-grm-group-and-rtf-electronic-music-studio-pierre-schaeffer-jacques-poullin-france-1951/) [FR], the [*Westdeutscher Rundfunk Köln*](http://120years.net/wordpress/wdr-electronic-music-studio-germany-1951/) [DE]  were seen as *expressly* artistic studios. The [*Funkhaus*](https://www.funkhaus-berlin.net/) [GDR] in East Berlin was the most sprawling recording studios in the world, and extensively wiretapped by the surveillance obsessed Stasi. In contrast the BBC Radiophonic had an express utility, to create sonic effects for radio (*The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*) and incidental music for TV (*Doctor Who*), particularly serving the civic purpose of British educational broadcasts. An otherworldly creative soundset put to use to reach millions in the sonic stings of70s/80s school documentaries, now spoofed in [*'Look Around You'*](https://youtu.be/z2myFLUDB74?si=3k2imbzdtBEAxc9i).  

The BBC Radiophonic Workshop was [drawn to a close in 1998](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195368406.003.0006). With new technology much of its work could be outsourced, and despite being funded from the shared civic model of the TV licence, it had been given 5 years to demonstrate economic self-sustainability. Key figures left the workshop and it closed under this market logic. An inevitable foreclosure; if you follow government fiscal policy where the BBC licence fee is [not public money but taxpayer's money](https://youtu.be/4luBQ8b1j28) and a philosophy that really, [there is no such thing as a society](https://youtu.be/WhJvOKJCYP4?si=7YmWcwBZPSolZ7Hn). Though, one wonders how to continue running [children's programming that discusses the realpolitik](https://youtu.be/_G4dHRN2Dug) of keeping 'true' administrative continuity after the Vietnamese army deposed the *horrific*, brutal, atrocity ridden Communist Party of Kampuchea (Cambodia). 

### There is No Alternative

I grew up in an age of unending neocon rule, and the complicity of [neoliberal alternatives](https://img.gifglobe.com/grabs/peepshow/S05E02/S05E02-iJmYPUVI-subtitled.jpg), throughout my childhood years. George Bush Jr had assumed his father's role in office (and resumed his father's war) and John Howard was in power for 11 years, long enough to bring me into my teens. As far as I knew, smiling jingoism and cynical geopolitical calculus *was* the way one kept power as a head of state. What mattered was the simulation of success, and the [*projection* of victory](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviatemin/2021/07/20/its-not-over-until-its-over-the-perils-of-declaring-victory-in-crisis-too-soon/). 

There felt like a dearth of grassroots protest songs reaching mass broadcast during the Second Gulf War. There are no synths on American Idiot, straight pop-punk rock and [heavy use of a pitch correction](https://youtu.be/r00ikilDxW4?si=84gWBNzAgYLY6Wvh) technology [originating the oil industry](https://www.businessinsider.com/auto-tune-developed-by-oil-engineer-2014-7). US radio charts remained similarly silent on the ancillary Middle Eastern wars, though Brian Williams dropped a Leonard Cohen reference in the guiding [beauty of their weapons](https://youtu.be/DrADbquuMb4?si=0RndBZy2hpTSTtFo) watching the missiles used against the Assad regime in Syria.

While the radios felt muted, The War on Terror was remote, dispersed, and silent. No air raid sirens provided warning and there was no shelter to take. Instead, a Homeland Security colour scale was used to assess the current terror threat level. Throughout the entire decade it sat in the warm colours; never dropping to 'general risk' (*blue*) or 'low risk' (*green*). It hit *red* ('severe risk') once during actionable insights to UK<->US flight threats, raised to *orange* ('high risk') five times outside of NYC in 2003. Otherwise it remained at a constantly ominous *yellow* ('elevated risk') until replaced by a new system in 2011. In fact, it was recommended to remove the low risk tiers altogether, setting the alert constantly on 'guarded' without reworking the classification criteria. Luckily, civil servants pushed back on [raising the 'guarded' threat level on the eve of an election](https://web.archive.org/web/20130419031645/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h1W_dkUJZmLCnpf-AJQwNa0N-ptg) due to opportunistic political ramifications. 

This created the conditions where the world lived under the constant drone of anxiety, never knowing where it would strike next. Swiftly to follow were legal memoranda [massively expanding surveillance activities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act), making ['enhanced interrogation' legally permissible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_Memos), giving the president significant executive authority over the [largest federal internal security organisation created since the end of WWII](https://www.dhs.gov/homeland-security-act-2002), and unilateral engagement in overseas conflicts by the executive without going through Congress or the [War Powers Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution) by not formally declaring war. Because after all, [wars end](https://youtu.be/RXUqJC3rXV0?si=ss5X714wTySJ41TW). The world's police had become the world's SWAT team.

--- Plato, *The Republic* (Benjamin Jowett's translation)

### Noise as a Resistance 

Even in eras when power feels absolute and alternatives seem erased, small acts of rebellion persisted —-- sometimes in music, sometimes in code, sometimes in the quiet persistence of niche communities. The 70s and 80s saw an independent music label scene rise and thrive (Rough Trade, 4AD, Factory Records). Some acts escaped the need for societal narrative by constructing tracks of pure sonic beauty, paying no heed to unintelligible lyrics --- turning the [human voice into another synthesizer](https://youtu.be/6KnYw4EwYGc?si=D8C76mbWTDlrmYHw). Under austere conditions, others turned the new wave rougher and more combative --- into punk.

This was a time that the official broadcasters would suffer the occasional subversive performance: such as [Elvis Costello getting permanently banned from Saturday Night Live](https://youtu.be/eD_24nDzkeo?si=yk9AMf1ox-VP8iQz); [London Calling](https://youtu.be/EfK-WX2pa8c?si=osOvS_wp2XYRTmOV) snuck into the radio as a hit, though their more clearly read songs faced the ire of BBC censors; and [Sex Pistols were banned from BBC airplay](https://youtu.be/q31WY0Aobro?si=2pajhGGpSqThZw3Q), though it wasn't only punk but [Johnny Rotten outing widely known predatory behaviour](https://youtu.be/v4OzI9GYag0?si=NCC8ita85r6Ebqcd) at the BBC that got them the boot.

The dissolution of this noisy resistance movement resulted in underground and invisible pockets:
- Independent distribution models couldn't scale up to keep up with major label infrastructure. 
- Mergers of independents into majors; Rough Trade and 4AD survive as Beggars Group label holdings.
- MTV became the commercial gatekeepers, you couldn't just sound good you needed to look good doing it.
- Music piracy eroded record profitability, forcing reliance on touring and stadium-sized ticket sale boons.
- Internet distribution meant the obscure found its audience, but leeps communities small and fragmented.

% Myths and Legendary Tapes to finish it off here. Last gasp of noise as a resistance, but it's a historical biopic nobody can acquire any more. This stuff is just cut up and weaved in to our mishmash digital weird world.

### Digital Palimpsests

The digital audio workstation (DAW) [evolved from early synhtesis machines](https://www.musicradar.com/news/daphne-oram-oramics-daw), and now provide a near-infinite collection of sound banks and samples, as long as the gestalt sound was generated somewhere, somehow


Ain't it funny how Delia's [meat-and-veggies synth experiments](https://youtu.be/jpdiMcEeTJA?si=gtoC47FIZ5K6xdaa) re-emerged as a sample in [2016's most lauded experimental hip-hop album](https://youtu.be/LVyGxlgeAjc?si=CC0S1o0nTOJHlIu2). Such sonic overlaying is no accident, it's the very origins of hip-hop's Disc Jockey culture, and continued source of fun in crate digging at a record fair. 

The reverberations of early synth warbles are reproduced into the 90s, with the [slightly surreal start-up sound](https://youtu.be/8jjT4AjTUMA?si=IyUeTVKZ7Or9moO9) in one of the [biggest corporate computing launches in tech history](https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/w3ct5yfs). Just in time to [connect everyone to the information super highway](https://web.archive.org/web/20120824202929/http://pewinternet.org/Static-Pages/Trend-Data-%28Adults%29/Internet-Adoption.aspx) when a "carpet bombing" campaign of free CDs (nearing half of CDs manufactured worldwide) brought [America Online](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object/nmah_1395721).

Computers used to be physical monoliths. They [filled entire rooms](/images/csirac.jpg), took teams of people punching cards to operate them, and their commissioning was a matter of national priority and pride. See: [ENIAC](https://almanac.upenn.edu/archive/v42/n18/eniac.html), [EDSAC](https://www.whipplemuseum.cam.ac.uk/explore-whipple-collections/calculating-devices/edsac-and-computing-cambridge) [UK], [MESM](https://cacm.acm.org/blogcacm/the-mesm-ukraine-beats-russia/) [USSR], [CSIRAC](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/about/history/csirac) [AU], [WEIZAC](https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~www/pages/milestones/1954.html) [IL], [TAC](https://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/dawn/0021.html) [JP], *etc*... 

These national behemoths did not dominate for long. Computer luminaries like [Grace Hopper advocating for systems involving smaller, distributed computing machines](https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_History/Hopper_Grace/102702026.05.01.pdf). Information exchange and data sharing was cracked wide open by computer networking pioneered at the ARPA and RAND agencies, with Stanford and UCLA the first nodes joined together in 1969 to grow into the [US-wide ARPANET in the 1970s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Arpanet_logical_map,_march_1977.png). By the 1980s [symposia on distributed computing](https://www.podc.org/) were held and [Local Area Networks](https://lovetechai.com/history-of-lan/) began to spring up. But the Internet of the World Wide Web as we know it was only formed in the 90s, built upon a common communication protocol (TCP/IP), the hypertext system of linked information [proposed at the world's largest particle physics institute](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/History.html), the [WorldWideWeb](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb.html) browser developed to surf the 'net, and from the mid-90s onwards the "browser wars" [saw software vie for market share](https://youtu.be/Hdit5-yFHI8?si=YU_D1uUt8_7J4z6o).

This enabled distributed communication at a then-astounding scale, but what about distributing *computing power itself*? 

While the `.com` commercial web was centralizing around Internet Service Providers and browser portals, another model was emerging on university campuses.

### Federation Returns

The world's premier engineering institute was hampered by a lack of computers available for their courses. Mainframes had been available on campus for decades, in fact the first computer to use [magnetic core memory](https://mitmuseum.mit.edu/collections/object/2000.006.001) had been developed on site for the US Navy. But there was a dire need to modernise computing access outside of specialised systems intended for operation by computer engineers and timeshared to grant holders. 

[Project Athena was launched at MIT](https://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-looking-back-project-athena-distributed-computing-for-students-1111) in 1983 to the tune of $100 million dollars, the largest ever undertaken. The computing transformation at MIT was done in collaboration with the two titans of the computer industry IBM (International Business Machines) and DEC (Digital Equipment corporation) who supplied hundreds to thousands of terminals, microcomputers, and workstations.


The model was this: users interfaces through easy to set up `clients` (terminals, workstations) which communicated to powerful clustered computing `servers` that did the operation-crunching for their requests. In this way a campus-wide network of computers could be deployed to meet the needs in each faculty. Unix was used as the operating system for this distributed computing network, and MIT put designed effort for their system to be vendor-agnostic, so they weren't locked in to either IBM or DEC's hardware compatibilities. One way this was achieved was through `thin clients`: the workstation didn't need to provide the computing power itself, acting only as a consistent interface to a wider variety of computing hardware on the back end. This Athenian league of federated academic computing environments can still be found in use at [MIT's Information Systems & Technology website](https://ist.mit.edu/athena).  
 
Project Athena not only cemented the foundations of `client-server` distributed computing architecture we all used today, but also brought with it many innovations:
- The Kerberos (AKA Cerberus) authentication protocol --- the default method of securing corporate computer networks from Windows 2000 onwards.
- The Unix framework for remote graphical user interfaces (the 'X Window System')
- One of the first internet protocol Instant Messaging (IM) services
- A *public* campus-wide Bulletin Board System (BBS)
- Online computer help (reminiscent of the modern helpdesk)

MIT, IBM, and DEC [reflected on the impacts of Project Athena partway through](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/4547.4553), but perhaps the greatest marker of achievements of Project Athena was its successful wider spread.

> "I felt that we would know Athena was successful if we were surprised by some of the applications. It turned out that our surprises were largely in the humanities."


--- Dr Joel Moses, then head of the Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS) 

Distributed computing took rapid foothold outside of MIT by the early 90s because it was *useful*. Several US and some international campuses started using an implementation (DECathena, now [Debathena](https://debathena.mit.edu/)), though invariable the protocols and hardware implementations changed with the frenetic obslence pace of the computing industry. The impact was conceptual, the model was no longer the monolith "supercomputer", but instead users work at domestic `clients` accessing distributed `servers` (nowdays often a "[Beowulf cluster](https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2020/it_1.html)" of commodity computing parts). Computing was now non-local and the arc of technological the implications leads to virtual desktops, enterprise computing, cloud computing, and modern web services. 
 - Cloud computing and social media oligopolies
 - Fediverse, but we'll focus on raw compute not communication

Section on the transformative federated computing projects:
- Grid computing
- SETI@home
- Folding@home

### The Owl of Minverva 🦉 

Wisdom takes flight only at dusk, often when it's too late.

Why do things continue to collapse into imperial tributary systems until there's a technological or social systematic shock?
Do lost futures only become visible when an era has already past, or because they only become visible in the murky twilight?

Technology shock permeates quickly, but has financial incentives to be harnessed by status quo power structures. Just because distributed information systems are easier to implement than ever doesn't mean we're guaranteed a future free from tribute to a few monoliths. When power projection moved slowly, the civic world made gods of the rulers of fiefdoms. Even now those structures are deliberate and social; a new type of economic elect in an era where information, goods exchange, and coordination systems can span the world in an instant.

Yet the alternatives keep emerging --- Athena persists, new federations form. The twilight offers a moment to breathe, to choose alternate futures.
Let's hope social coordination and civic productivity can free up our future, one not driven to mass unrest or conflict as its remaining system shock mechanism.

The palimpsest is the internet centralising to platforms web 1.0 -> web 2.0 -> fake federation of blockchain/crypto and real federated media alteratives. And federation computing being a way forward for scientific computing

-- Conquest -> capital -> empire   it's all about saying that our interconnection, trade, and interdependence *must* be mediated by a monopoly of force centre isn't it?

- The Lycian League
  - Only Hellenestic state to resist the Lydians (led by Croesus, a king so rich his wealth could only be explained by Midas's golden touch creating golden river during washing)
  - Very last territory in Anatolia to be incorporated into the Roman Empire
  - The Delian League under Athenian (the rebellious league was crushed an Lycia had to return fealty to the Persians)
  - 4thC, throw off th eyoke. Perikles organises the provinces revolt against the Satraps
  - Conquered by Alexander the Great
- Amazing art and coinage. Prefected nearby invetions. Cliff tombs and coffins. Own language. 
- Federated democracies (circle back at end with federated computing?)

  - https://www.barnabyrogerson.com/articles-talks/lycia
- [Lycia] "After a brief membership in the Athenian Empire, it seceded and became independent (its treaty with Athens had omitted the usual non-secession clause)"
- [Wikipedia] "In these latter stages of the Roman Republic, Lycia came to enjoy freedom as a Roman protectorate. The Romans validated home rule officially under the Lycian League in 168 BC. This native government was an early federation with republican principles;"
- Athenian Ideals
- Ze owl
- Athenian tributary and Imperialism
- An anti-Imperial protection league because an Athenian client state -- knlowledge but also war
- 4 *hundred* years, outlasted any modern democratic nation state.
- Stable federation that didn't become a great power through conquest. A lost future that faded away due to expansionist neighbours. History written in terms of wars (get that quote about boys being raised up in a history of war to think it's normal)
- Longer lasting than modern nation states, and stabler considerin the global calamitoius conflicts that engulfed them in the first half of the 20th Century
- The Ancient Civilisation that inspired US Democracy: https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230906-the-ancient-civilisation-that-inspired-us-democracy
- OMG the Federalist Papers mentions the Lycian League and contrasts ancient confedarcies vs American Federation
 - In Federalist Papers [9](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed09.asp), [16](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed16.asp), [45](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed45.asp) and held as an example the United States of America being a confederation of states that would not fall to tyranny.
 - Wow the 'Hamilton' connection and the US now electing a demagogue and sliding into tyranny
- Madison cited them at the Constitutional Convention
- America as the isolationist state turning to the 'World's Police' after being drawn into WWII
- Germany and expansion into neigbhouring democracies that were drawing back into themselves as the imperial project collapsed
- The thousand year realm myth
- The centre of the hegemon was no longer safe with modern technological developments. With the V2 you could hit the capital regardless of whether the sun ever set on your holdings. There *is* no buffer
- Geographic empire becomes obsolete, but the logic of centralization persists even when it doesn't make sense anymore.
- The Blitz
- Delia Derbyshire
- Maths and physics at Cambridge to make *sounds* not plot the trajectories of bombs
- The Lissajous polynomials, oscilloscopes, sounds, and the ABC logo (rage?).
- Ruby Payne-Scott
- Air-raid sirens, literally growing up in the Blitz
- Turning the sound of fascism into the post-war reconstruction civic society
- Now it feels quaint because the civic project was lost with Thatcherism, neolibrealism and New Labour
- Hauntology, lost futures
- Thatcher "There is no alternative"
- Hegemonic instutional self-preservation evaluative structures - "Subject to the Ladder"
- Radiophonic - policy was "staff" contributions were the remain anonymous. Legacies could *only* be evaluated in hindsight
- Radiophonic funding killed
  - It was defunded because it was given 5 years to *break even*
	- Under Blair! New Labour! Neoliberal economics
- Weave in my aunt recovering a lost piece of Dalek footage that was discarded by the BBC due to funding cuts but with still in the colonial outputs of the ABC archives
  - Delia Derbyshire composing the Dr Who theme in a experimental and economically oddball funding of the public broadcaster, meant to make educational and backing sounds and ended up experimental
  - The colonial outposts preserved what the imperial centre discarded.
  - The funding cuts due to neocon government economics.
- Also people thought synthesised music could be psychological dangerous, BBC health and safety imposed a limit of 3 months in the Radiophonic Workshop to avoid prolonged exposure to alternative frequencies. 
%  - literal fear of alternative frequencies
- It became DANCE MUSIC. Free of content and structured around repition for pure hedonism. (link to Delia's [offhand prototehcno track](https://youtu.be/vwQIgGQLOQ8?si=Yf1WghFeNgDIemjQ), first techno beat)
  - I think my take on Dance Music is there's a loss of civic purpose, but also a freedom from narrative and official record. You can just be, dance, exist, have fun, you don't need to *serve a state purpose or national cause*
- The early synths pioneer were often unconventional in social categories
- "The Myths and Legendary Tapes" also basically lost in the digital age when distribution is easy
- Murals and a plamipsest of public civic aspiration
- Lost futures: "It's easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism"
- The end of history (sike)
- The goddamn "apocalypse rave at the end of the world" BBC news audio sting bit
- Delia Debyshire day
- Web 1.0 => 2.0 => 3.0 ([which is going just great](https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/)) as the lost futures and fading palimpsest of our digital inscriptions
- Federated Computing in social media, but also in scientific research
- Federated data. Gaia-X? OpenFold training on federated big pharma data with Apheris: https://www.apheris.com/resources/blog/apheris-launches-apherisfold-to-make-openfold3-securely-usable-in-pharma-environm
- Mention Flux, and avant-garde new computing scheduler, has built in multi-*site* scheduling mechanisms 

- The Lycians lasted 400 years. We remember Athens. History is written by empires, but the federations were there, in the twilight, the whole time.
