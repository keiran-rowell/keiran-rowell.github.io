I'm passionate about education, access to information, and excited about the potential of digital technologies in teaching. My research specialisation is in physical chemistry, and I have taught diverse science subjects at all university and highschool levels. I take pride in incisivie and insightful teaching, encouragning students towards initiutive chemical understanding and rigorous scientific reasoning. Student assesment forms and feedback demonstrate their engagment and appreciation for my lessons, and once they comprehend a productive model they can reinforce their confidence in seeing how experiment and data fit with theory, rather than rote learning disjointed facts. 

## University Teaching -- Teaching Fellow Program
I was thrilled to be part of the inaugural cohort of [UNSW Chemistry Teaching Fellows](https://www.chemistry.unsw.edu.au/current-students/postgraduate-research/scholarships/teaching-fellowship "UNSW Chemistry Teaching Fellows details"), and throughout my PhD I delivered 2-3 tutorials 1st year chemistry tutorials per week and recieved structure training, debriefing and mentoring from Coordinator Dr Kim Lapere and other education-focussed staff. Additionally, I mentored the Teaching Fellows in
later cohorts, created instructional hand-outs for physical chemistry (orbitals), undertook exam marking, outreach, and developed resources for 3rd year physical chemistry (detailed below).


## Juypter Notebooks for Physical Chemistry -- Rising Star Award (PhD Causal Teachers)
The capacity for tech to improve how the physical sciences are taught is enormous, and I elected to develop 3rd year physical chemistry resources as part of my Teaching Fellowship. Physical and computational chemistry are increasingly reliant on programming,  algorithms, and data analysis and I wanted to develop an accessible entry point to those skills for chemistry students who have varied (or no) background in computer science. For this I turned to Python,
using chemistry-specific examples to apply code in context familiar to sutdents, and Jupyter notebooks to avoid any technical hassle in providing a consistent environment. 

I deployed a cloud-hosted Jupyter Hub for demonstrative purposes, and you can see my pitch video for general education audience by clicking on the image below.

I won the UNSW Rising Star Award (PhD Casual Teachers) for my resources and my teaching feedback, and you can find an interview upon the award [in the newsletter here](https://mailchi.mp/034ed4ae6bb3/march-2019-newsletter-from-the-dean-of-science-460037), including discussion of my teaching philosphy.

These notebooks were adapted and incorporated into the redesigned CHEM3011 'Quantum Nature of Molecules' course at UNSW in collaboration with Drs Junming Ho and Laura McKemmish. I demonstrated this redesigned CHEM3011 in 2019 and 2020, and course satsifcation rose dramatically from 65% to 94%, with the use of digital instruction being crucially important for remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Highschool Teaching
I worked as a causal science teacher at [Matrix Education](https://www.matrix.edu.au/) throughout my PhD. I taught mainly Chemistry (Y11 & Y12) and Junior Science (Y9 & Y10) and achieved conistently high ratings from students, with a 4.7/5 student experience questionnaire 2-year average rating across all classes. I have also tutored privately and through companies ever since leaving highschool.  I've been involved in several highschool outreach events, including [SciX@UNSW](https://www.science.unsw.edu.au/using-computational-tools-develop-new-materials-water-purification) science extension instruction and other highschool visits.
