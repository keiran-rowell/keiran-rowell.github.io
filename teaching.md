# Teaching

## Philosophy 
I'm passionate about education, access to information, and its power for social progress. I pride myself on a [good presentation](https://github.com/keiran-rowell/Presentations) with clear slides and an incisive message. I am very excited about the potential of digital technologies in teaching. My research specialisation is in physical chemistry, and I have taught diverse science subjects at university and high school levels. I find satisfaction in insightful teaching, encouraging students to nurture intuitive chemical perspective and rigorous scientific reasoning. Student assessment forms and feedback demonstrate their engagement and value gained from my lessons. I aim for students to comprehend a productive theoretical model they can use to reinforce their confidence in seeing how experiment and data fit their knowledge, rather than rote learning disjointed facts. 

## University Teaching -- Teaching Fellow Program
I was thrilled to be part of the inaugural cohort of [UNSW Chemistry Teaching Fellows](https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/our-schools/chemistry/student-life-resources/teaching-fellowship), and throughout my PhD I delivered 2-3 first year chemistry tutorials per week and received structured training, debriefing, and mentoring from Coordinator Dr Kim Lapere and other education-focussed staff. Additionally, I mentored the Teaching Fellows from later cohorts, created instructional handouts for atomic orbitals, undertook exam marking, outreach, and developed resources for 3rd year physical chemistry (*detailed below*).


## Jupyter Notebooks for Physical Chemistry -- Rising Star Award (PhD Causal Teachers)
The capacity for tech to improve how the physical sciences are taught is enormous, and I chose to develop 3rd year physical chemistry resources as part of my Teaching Fellowship. Physical and computational chemistry are increasingly reliant on programming,  algorithms, and data analysis and I wanted to develop an accessible entry point to those skills for chemistry students who have varied (or no) background in computer science. 

For this I turned to Python, using chemistry-specific examples to apply code in context familiar to students, and Jupyter notebooks to avoid any technical hassle in providing a consistent environment. I deployed a cloud-hosted JupyterHub to demonstrate this in a general audience pitch video, click the image below to watch.

I received the UNSW Rising Star Award (PhD Casual Teachers) for my resources and teaching. You can find an interview upon the award [in the newsletter here](https://mailchi.mp/034ed4ae6bb3/march-2019-newsletter-from-the-dean-of-science-460037), including discussion of my teaching philosophy.

My notebooks were incorporated into the redesigned CHEM3011 'Quantum Nature of Molecules' course at UNSW in collaboration with Drs Junming Ho and Laura McKemmish. I demonstrated this redesigned CHEM3011 course in 2019 and 2020, and course satisfaction rose dramatically from 65% to 94%. The use of Jupyter notebooks and other digitial learning environments were crucially important for remote teaching of CHEM3011 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## High School Teaching
I worked as a causal science teacher at [Matrix Education](https://www.matrix.edu.au/) throughout my PhD. I taught mainly Chemistry (Y11 & Y12) and Junior Science (Y9 & Y10) and achieved consistently high ratings from students, with a 4.7/5 student experience questionnaire 2-year average rating across all classes. I have also tutored privately and through companies ever since leaving high school.  I've been involved in several high school outreach events, including [SciX@UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/study-with-us/scix-school-extension-program) science extension and other high school visits.
