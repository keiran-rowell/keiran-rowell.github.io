  about:             |
I am a computational chemist and instructor, working as postdoctoral researcher at the University of Sydney. I undertake research into the theory and calculation of photochemical reactions and dynamics for carbonyl (C=O) containing molecules, collaborating closely with exprimental colleagues at UNSW. 
    
I've always been fascinated about how to model the mechanisms of the natural world, and enthusiastic about the capabilities of computation and tech to provide exquisite mechanistic insight. I'm applications driven -- with published work using excited state quantum chemical method, molecular dynamics modelling of DNA, and coursework in bioinformatics. I'd love to combine my skills into multiscale modelling approaches to captivating research areas like photobiology and DNA photodamage.
