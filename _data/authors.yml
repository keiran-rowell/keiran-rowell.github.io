    Keiran Rowell is a scientist living on unceded Gadigal land in Sydney, Australia.

  #I'm a computational scientist, interested in all things occuring on the molecular scale. <br>
  #I've bumbled around Australian universities, attempting to extract meaning from calculated data. My PhD was in photochemistry; trying to work out the rules that cause bond-breaking in atmospheric molecules -- whereas my Honours was in molecular dynamics, simulating how drugs bind into the DNA double-helix. I love teaching, and was glad to be recognised with a 'Rising Star' award by UNSW Science. I worked at Matrix Education for a long while, inspiring the next generation to think analytically. <br>
  #When not working, I'm likely to be exercising my frustration out through swords, at a gig, or sitting with a pot of tea and a good book.
