# About

<!--author-->

## Scientific Interests
I'm fascinated by the mechanisms of the natural world, and enthusiastic about the capabilities of computation and tech to provide exquisite mechanistic insight. I'm applications driven -- with published work using excited state quantum chemical methods, molecular dynamics modelling of DNA, as well as coursework in bioinformatics. I'd love to combine my skills into multiscale modelling approaches to captivating research topics such as: photobiology, enzyme catalysis, and DNA photodamage.

## Computational Interests
I have 5+ years working in Linux and high performance computing environments, writing shell scripts and commands to automate my calculations, data management and analysis. For larger scripts and code Python is my go-to language, and also my choice for student instruction due to its acessiblity. Much of the extant computational chemsitry codes are built on Fortran, and I have working familarity compiling and modifying Fortran codebases. A plethora of file formats and data-structures proliferate in computational chemistry, so I regularly need to write parsing, data extraction, and translation scripts. I studied undegraduate computer science and bioinformatics courses, in which I wrote C code for  foundational data-structures and algorithms, as well as sequence alignment and biological analysis code. 

I've organised migration of research code to a group GitHub Enterprise repository, and managed a small compute cluster used by experimental collaborators.  I am a strong believer in open-source software and try and adopt FOSS tools such as matplotlib, inkscape, GIMP, and latex for document and figure preperation, and Overleaf for collaboration. Vim is my main editor for its expressive efficiency, particularly for the file munging required to process computational chemistry calculations.
