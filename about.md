# About

<!--author-->

## Scientific Interests

I'm fascinated by the mechanisms of the natural world, and enthusiastic about the capabilities of computation and tech to provide exquisite mechanistic insight. I'm applications driven -- with published work using excited state quantum chemical methods, molecular dynamics modelling of DNA; and coursework in bioinformatics. I'd love to combine my skills into multiscale modelling approaches to captivating research topics such as photobiology, enzyme catalysis, and DNA photodamage.
