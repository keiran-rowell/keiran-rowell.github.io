<p>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</p>

<p>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and

<p>By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License
(“Public License”). To the extent this Public License may be
interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in

     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed

     agreements.</p>

     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,

     individually chosen by them.</p>

<p>m. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of

<p>Section 2 – Scope.</p>

<p>a. License grant.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
      the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
      non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
      exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

        a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
           in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and

        b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
           NonCommercial purposes only.

   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
      Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
      License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
      its terms and conditions.

   3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
      6(a).

   4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
      Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
      all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
      and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
      Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
      authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
      necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
      technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
      Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
      simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
      (4) never produces Adapted Material.

   5. Downstream recipients.

        a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
           recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
           receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
           Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
           Public License.

        b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
           Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
           automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
           under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

        c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
           any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
           apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
           Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
           Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
           Material.

   6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
      may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
      are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
      with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
      the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
      provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>b. Other rights.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
      licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
      privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
      the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
      assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
      extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
      Rights, but not otherwise.

   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
      Public License.

   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
      collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
      Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
      under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
      licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
      reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
      the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
      purposes.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Section 3 – License Conditions.</p>

<p>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.</p>

<p>a. Attribution.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
      form), You must:

        a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
           with the Licensed Material:

             i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                Material and any others designated to receive
                attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                designated);

            ii. a copyright notice;

           iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of

        c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
           Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
           hyperlink to, this Public License.

   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
      reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
      which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
      reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
      hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
      information.

      reasonably practicable.

<p>b. ShareAlike.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
 Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

   1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
      license with the same License Elements, this version or
      later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.

   2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
      Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
      in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
      context in which You Share Adapted Material.

   3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
      or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
      Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
      rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.

<p>Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.</p>

<p>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:</p>

<p>a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
     only;</p>

<p>b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and</p>

<p>c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.</p>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.</p>

<p>Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</p>

<p>a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<p>b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<p>c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.</p>

<p>Section 6 – Term and Termination.</p>

<p>a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.</p>

<p>b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
      it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
      violation; or

   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
 right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
 of this Public License.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.</p>

<p>d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.</p>

<p>Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.</p>

<p>a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.</p>

<p>b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.</p>

<p>Section 8 – Interpretation.</p>

<p>a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.</p>

<p>b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.</p>

<p>c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.</p>

<p>d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</p>
