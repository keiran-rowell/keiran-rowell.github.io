<p><em>In this post I’m aiming to give a broad-brush overview of how near-infinite array of colours we see in textiles today was wrought from some the of most murky carbon substances known. This post will focus on purple (specifically, mauveine). I’d like to more on specific dyes in the future because they have so many fascinating chemical properties. For example, indigo forms from the dimer of the common indole group in biochemistry, placing it within striking distance of tryophan in the biosynthetic pathway.</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/indole_metabolism_in_plants.png" alt="Indigo biosynthesis in plants" /></p>

<p class="figcaption">Indigo is made from joining two slighly modified indole molecules. Indole is such a common structure in biology that it is used to make typtophan, one of the 20 standard amino acids, which can reveal protein folding properties through fluorescence.   [Synthesis diagram from <em>Plant Cell Reports</em>, Volume 35, pages 2449–2459, <strong>(2016)</strong>].</p>

<p><em>The development of dyes used to be covered in a (rarely taught) NSW syllabus option, “Chemistry of Art”, which touched on everything from indigenous dyes to transition metal pigments and atomic spectroscopy, but is sadly now gone. For those interested in colour more generally, I can recommend</em> <a href="https://www.kassiastclair.com/books">“The Secret Lives of Colour”</a> <em>for its addictive ease to pick-up and dive into each hue, and</em> <a href="https://www.rca.ac.uk/more/staff/neil-parkinson/">“The History of Colour”</a> <em>for an academic history of the conception of colour (Chapter 2 starts with synthetic purple and details the explosion in commerically valuable tints that followed). If the industrial dye developments interests you, BASF have well produced and comprehensive account of their entire history <a href="https://www.basf.com/global/en/who-we-are/history/chronology/1865-1901.html">on their website</a>.</em></p>

<h3 id="pauvre-mauve-">Pauvre mauve 🪻</h3>

<p>There’s an abundance of green in the natural world (because plants harness the abundant red light from our sun), but blues and purples stick out because they are so <a href="https://set.adelaide.edu.au/news/list/2019/08/20/why-is-the-colour-blue-so-rare-in-nature">rare in nature</a>. Maybe that’s why blue is <a href="https://au.yougov.com/international/articles/12336-why-blue-worlds-favorite-color-1">humanity’s favourite colour</a>. Bird and butterfly wings have to restort to optical trickery (metamaterials), blueberries get their name and antioxidant health craze because their skin packed with the crop pigment <a href="https://en.wikipediea.org/wiki/Anthocyanin">anthocynanin</a>, and the blue skin of the poison dart frog is from the very same chemical (pumiliotoxin) that makes it poisonous. Similarly, there’s an almost complete abscence of natural purple. Purple cabbage and eggplant contain the same anthocyanins as blueberries, and while violet flowers are so striking the colour is named after them, they do not make a colourfast dye that will last in fabric. So, when nature was our only source of chemicals, people’s desire the harness the spectrum of ‘cool’ colours came from crushing the leaves of the somewhat drab woad and the perennially popular indigo (which is both a type of plant and one of Newton’s seven ‘ROYGB<strong>I</strong>V’ colours).</p>

<p>The only concentrated, colourfast sources of organic purple come from the seas. <em>Aplysia</em> sea slugs <a href="https://youtu.be/qmn1bpz00qA?si=ajvqjlsCp7IaI25-">spray purple</a> aplysioviolin molecules when threatened, which they have built up from eating red algea, stripping the colour molecule from the algae’s light harvestting proteins, and concentrating a modified molecule in their ink glands. A painstaking, but more relaible, way to harvest natural purple is to extract ink glands from the <em>Murex</em> sea snail. The ‘Tyrian purple’ dye harvested from these snail glands was, and is, <a href="https://youtu.be/IVXqisH6VeM?si=mRh5GDGBscIPJDDH">outrageously expensive</a>, fetching around $3000 USD/g in the 21st century. Tyrian purple is in fact a bromoniated derivative of indigo, synthesised using a bromoperoxidase enzyme unique to Murex. Scientists still have not confirmed the active metal within the <em>Murex</em>’s bromoperoxidase enzyme (most bromoperoxidases use the rare Vanadium), or which sea snail gene encodes for it.</p>

<p>Even the colour diversity found within the minerals of the Earth was of little help; the naturally occuring pigments minerals are prone to dull hues, quick fading, and discolouration into green (<em>e.g.</em> azurite). Pure, brilliant blue mineral pigment was only provided eye wateringly expensive lapis lazuli (Ultarmarine), mined only in mountains on the North-Eastern tip of Afghanistan. Ultramarine would cost up to 100x other pigments, but its dazzling effect was used in relgious iconography across Asia and Europe and is a notable in famous paintings (<em>e.g.</em> the <a href="https://heritagesciencejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40494-020-00364-5">blue headscarf</a> in <em>“Girl with a Pearl Earring”</em>). Synthetic mineral blue dyes were also created in ancient times from copper Silicates (mixed with Ca - “Egyptian” Blue, or Ba - “Han” Blue &amp; Purple), or otherwise just from indigo ‘baked into’ a mineral substrate, as detailed in a in <em>Chemical Society Reviews</em> on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/B606268G">“The invention of blue and purple pigments in ancient times”</a>. Han Purple is not a pure purple, but is due to red-copper oxide impurities in production. All these synthetics, however, paled in comparison to “true” Ultramarine and lapis lazuli was in demand well into the 19th century. The physical origin of the intense blue appearance of Ultramarine is chemically interesting: rather than a light absorbing metal at the centre of the mineral, there is instead a caged negatively charged trisulfur radical (S\(_3^{.-}\)).</p>

<p>Now with modern chemistry, blue hues can be made that are so striking that an artist can make a multimillionair dollar name for themselves with <a href="https://www.invaluable.com/blog/yves-klein-blue/">one famous blue dye</a>, and scientific careers and reputations can be built upon chemists’ prowess to manufacture the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/quantum-blue-berkeley_n_5b8db0a4e4b0511db3db33a1">bluest blue</a>. The chemistry of commercially abundant purple dyes, however, was only cracked in the 19th, and now still purple and violet contain unplumbed depths in colour terminology, our <a href="https://jakubmarian.com/difference-between-violet-and-purple/">visual perception</a> near the UV wavelengths, and even the <a href="https://ericportis.com/posts/2024/okay-color-spaces/">colour range</a> of our computer monitors.</p>

<h3 id="born-in-the-purple-">Born in the purple 🟣</h3>

<p>Purple has long signified royalty and power, to the point that its use was restricted to high office. This wasn’t just due to the expense of natural purple dye, but was often enforced by social codes and law. Famously, Romans officials would line their formal attire (togas) with a strip of purple lining the border. This style, the <em>toga praetexta</em> (from Preator, a magistrate position below Consul) wasn’t restricted to appointed official, but likely had a religious origin and was worn by priests and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/693055i">pre-adolescent children of fortunate birth</a>. However, a toga fully clad in pruple was restricted to Roman conuls and generals performing a Triumph, and later to the Emperor alone, and the unsanctioned wearing of purple was even codified as an offence punishable by death during Nero’s reign. The association of the Tyrian purple hue with royalty extended beyond clothing, and Byzantine (Eastern Roman) queens would give birth to future rulers in rooms decorated with a deep-purple Imperal Porphyry (from Ancient Greek <em>porphyra</em> - lit. purple) stone. This colour distinction of the birthright to rule was enforced from cradle to grave, as Emperors were buried in tombs made from porhyry, some <a href="https://www.pallasweb.com/deesis/imperial-porphyry-tombs.html">survive today outside the Archealogical Museum in Instanbul</a>.</p>

<p>% Phorygineture</p>

<p>Ironically, despite the incredibly rarity of steadfast purple in nature, purple was the first in a tidal wave of synthetic industrial dyes, bringing the colour to the masses causing it to become commonplace and unfashionable in quickly after reaching the mass market. The discovery of artifical purple dye (mauvine) was entirely accidentally, but the chemical knowledge to synthesise at massive scale required the unravelling some of the fundemental mysteries in organic (carbon-based) chemistry, and clarification how electrons create molecular structure and govern the interactions of dye molecules with light.</p>

<p>Benzene is a molecule.</p>

  <li>Kekulé<br />
Gravity’s Rainbow qoute</li>
</ul>

<p>Kekulé serpentine solution of benzene’s structure is actually within the book Gravity’s Rainbow as a metaphor the economic boon that destructive cycle of WWII war economy brings:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Kekulé dreams the Great Serpent holding its own tail in its mouth, the dreaming Serpent which surrounds the World. But the meanness, the cynicism with which this dream is to be used. The Serpent that announces, “The World is a closed thing, cyclical, resonant, eternally-returning,” is to be delivered into a system whose only aim is to violate the Cycle. Taking and not giving back, demanding that “productivity” and “earnings” keep on increasing with time, the System removing from the rest of the World these vast quantities of energy to keep its own tiny desperate fraction showing a profit: and not only most of humanity—most of the World, animal, vegetable, and mineral, is laid waste in the process… No return, no salvation, no Cycle—that’s not what They, nor Their brilliant employee Kekulé, have taken the Serpent to mean. No: what the Serpent means is—how’s this—that the six carbon atoms of benzene are in fact curled around into a closed ring, just like that snake with its tail in its mouth, GET IT?”</p>
</blockquote>

The protagonist’s very name – Tryone – has be interpreted to be linked with Tyrian purple, and his essence with sliding colour scales, and his subjection to the totalisating nature of nomenclature and technology linked to the naming schemes of the colour industry.</li>

  <li>Add some history of why it was called aromaticity (scientist names). Talk about how aromatic ‘sections’ of molecules give them some of their most interesting chemical behaviour</li>
  <li>Resonance  – a terrible misnomer, as with most chemical nomenclature, because molecular nuclei do <em>not</em> ‘resonate’ between two separate resonance structures (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4027968">as many of the original theorists well knew, though confusion rose rapidly due partly to sloppy exposition by Pauling in a campaign to expand the conceptual basis of structural chemistry.</a>).

A vocal minority of Soviet scientists <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/227752">viewed the resonance concept as fictitious mathematical idealisation that was antithetical to dialectal materialism</a>, so the state adopted a terminological slight of hand to avoid referring to resonance or using ‘resonance structures’ as a teaching aid.</li>

  <li>Don’t let the historical account get in the way of a good story. <em>Chemical Reviews</em> provides a good instructional <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/cr0300946">review paper on this history</a>. Nevertheless, a sizeable chunk of Kekules students went on the work in the german Dye industry</li>
</ul>

<p>… this segues back in William Perkin knowing enough about aromatic chemistry to search for quinin precusors.  [Actually, Kekule’s benzene is in 1865 and Perkin discovers aniline purple in 1856.. so but Kekule after Perkin and leading into the German industrial behemothss</p>

% Azulene from azure ‘blue’ and the -ene suffix of double bonds.</p>

  <li>BASF - <em>Badische Anilin und Sodafabrik</em> (Baden Aniline and Sodium Carbonate Factory). The rise of this company was meteoric after <a href="/nitrogen-fixation/2023-06-14-nitrogen-fixation/">Haber and Bosch invented their method</a> to turn nitrogen from the air into fertiliser. The sodafabrik part of BASF is infamous of New South Wales highschool students who had to memorise the conditions of the Solvay process as part of their Industrial Chemistry module.</li>

  <li>BASF would go on to join I.G. Farben (very literally, “The Colour Syndicate”), a cartel appearing as a constant ominous industrial spectre stalking Gravity’s Rainbow, tragically mirroring how these scientifically and commercially pioneering chemical companies were wrested into the control of depraved, horrific warmongers; the ‘Them’ of the military-industrial complex which haunts the book’s entire narrative.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Huckel’s rule for aromaciticty: any cyclic arrangement of 4<em>n</em>+2 carbon atoms, where electrons are “shared” between all atoms in the ring, <em>n</em>=1,2,3…</li>
  <li>Figure of Huckel aromotacity and delocalised pi cloud</li>
  <li>Dyes are still a testbed for theoretical chemistry. Like revisiting the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp309006e">classic green and red dyes</a></li>
  <li>Some of Seth Olsen’s papers amongst others</li>
  <li>Link back to GFP chromophores etc?</li>
  <li>Mobius aromaticity?</li>
  <li>% Porphyrins (lit. purple) and electronic excitations should go here??</li>
  <li>% <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c07625">Research just last year</a> proposes why azulene’s light emission is special from the excited state: it has a unique anti-aromatic properties that means it disobeys a long standing principle in photochemistry – that photon emission is from the lowest electronic state of a give electron spin state. It also displays beautiful examples of (anti)aromatic ring currents.  %This paper has a really good illustration of pi-aromaticity, whether it forms multiple small rigns, or one large ring aroudn the perimeter</li>
  <li>% Bacteriorhodopsin, occurs in the “purple membrane” which is 60 % protein by weight, and perhaps intimately linked with vision itself as the origin origin of molecular basis of light detection since the retinal that has been used to pump protons is also what drives occular vision</li>

<hr />

<p>*Purple is my favourite colour :) Deep Purple is shrouded in mystique, while there’s something spectral about High Violet hinting at energetic light just beyond human perception.
