## Structure-Activity Relationships for Carbonyl Photolysis -- (PhD)
![Structure-activity relationships for carbonyls](/images/SARs_for_carbonyls.png)

The photochemistry of diverse small carbonyls can be used to predict the behaviour of atmospherically important molecules.

My PhD research was in the development of chemical relationships between the molecular structure of a carbonyl and how it reacts following UV light absorption. Carbonyls are central to the atmosphere, they are one of the few atmospheric molecules that absorb UV, the radicals they create from UV photolysis drive chemical cycles, and the C=O functional group is fomred abundantly when carbon-containing molecules oxidise in the atmosphere. Atmospheric chemistry models manage the simulation of thousands of
atmospheric molecules by using structure-activity relationships (SARs), but no SARs had been developed for carbonyl photolysis. Instead, cruder "surrogate" approximations are employed based upon experimental data for roughly a dozen molecules. 

My PhD thesis developed SARs from comprehensive reaction threshold calculations on 38 representative carbonyls, across all relevant electronic states. [My thesis](http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/65036) is currently the most complete overview of these carbonyl photolysis SARs. The dominant Norrish Type I photolysis reaction is covered in a [paper in JPCA](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpca.9b05534), and you can find preprints on the topic of other reactions and protocols [on ChemRxiv](https://chemrxiv.org/authors/Keiran_Rowell/9320888)


## Revising Neighbour-Exclusion in DNA Intercalators -- (Honours)
![Neighbour exclusion](images/neighbour_exclusion.png)

My simulations revise previous literature by indicating diacridines can insert into DNA without violating neighbour-exclusion.

I studied the insertion of diacridines (linked, flat aromatic molecules) into DNA for my Honours work, which recieved the top mark in Chemistry Honours and the Angyal Prize. I used molecular dynamics to study the structural feasiblity of various binding modes, analysing the insertion into over hundred different sequences (A,T,C,G combinations at the binding site). These dynamics trajectories showed that insertion of both acridine ends was viable and in agreement with empirical measurements. I also performed fragment-based quantum chemical and free energy calculations to attempt to determine the basis of the neighbour-exclusion principle, i.e. insertion cannot occur at adjacent base-pairs, whose physical origins are still unclear. This work is detailed in a [paper in Biopolymers](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bip.23409).
