# Projects

Here are my scientific interests and research projects


## Structure-activity Relationships for Carbonyl Photolysis -- (PhD)
![Structure-activity relationships for carbonyls](/images/SARs_for_carbonyls.png)

The photochemistry of diverse small carbonyls can be used to predict the behaviour of atmospherically important molecules.

## Revising Neighbour-Exclusion in DNA Intercalators -- (Honours)
![Neighbour exclusion](images/neighbour_exclusion.png)

My simulations revise previous literature by indicating diacridines can insert into DNA without violating neighbour-exclusion.
