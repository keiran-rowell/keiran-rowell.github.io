Here are my scientific interests and research projects


## Structure-activity Relationships for Carbonyl Photolysis -- (PhD)
![Structure-activity relationships for carbonyls](/images/SARs_for_carbonyls.png)

From the photochemistry of small, structurally representative carbonyls the behaviour of large atmospherically important species can be predicted.

## Revising Neighbour-Exclusion in DNA Intercalators -- (Honours)
![Neighbour exclusion](images/neighbour_exclusion.png)

My simulations indicate diacridines can insert in DNA without violating the neighbour-exclusion principle, revising previous literature.
